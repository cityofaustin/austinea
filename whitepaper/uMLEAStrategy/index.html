<p style="font-weight: bold;" id="intro">Introduction</p>

<p>Some believe, incorrectly, that the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is not a useful tool to perform enterprise analysis for the purpose of enterprise architecture (EA). Although the UML (a visual and textual language) is not particularly easy to learn; once mastered, it offers many scalable analysis methods to communicate information to the non-technical while developing an understandable enterprise strategy - an import principle of a good EA. Through this paper, I'll explain a process a skilled enterprise architect might use to achieve a successful UML EA practice. I recognize there are plenty of architecture masters out there, so I will not claim this approach provides all the answers useful to a successful EA practice. However, depending on your enterprise architecture needs, it does offer a &quot;practical&quot; guide one might use to explore the UML's potential and there are many benefits. Figure 1 provides the meta-model for this discussion.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-indent: .2in;" id="benefits">- Benefits</p>

<p>The most significant benefit we've realized is the ability to identify important business needs using a data-driven, decision-making framework. Our EA tells a story, a story understood by both business leaders and solution providers. The EA's story aligns information technology services to produce maximum business value and is effective in providing good customer relationship management by ensuring solution providers comprehend the business need. Due to the object-oriented nature of the language and its high-focus on business interfaces, the architecture is more likely to identify &quot;horizontally&quot; integrated enterprise solutions while exposing innovation opportunities. Finally, interface focused business models identify risk early to mitigate decisions and solutions before it's too late - i.e., you've made a expensive procurement or you're well into development.</p>

<p style="text-indent: .2in;"><i>I remember spending months working on an architecture only to have the customer cancel the program. In turn, the customer expressed great gratitude, they said, "Rob, what your architecture helped us realize was the amount of risk associated with our brainstormed business need. Without your architecture, we might have pursued a solution at great expense and still not realize our desired objective. In reality, your architecture that cost us only a few thousand dollars actually saved us millions! Thank you very much..."</i></p> 

<p>Architecture is about managing risk, dealing with complexity and communicating concepts to others - this is why we've abstracted the UML to the business space. Our intended audience is not only the business user but the solution provider and it's important they mutually understand the business need in unambiguous terms using a &quot;common language&quot; called the Unified Modeling Language and we've benefited greatly by having a common visual language as our communications medium.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-indent: .2in;" id="perspective">- EA Perspective</p>

<p>Before I get started, let me explain my perspective on EA. Largely, I believe EA's purpose is to align information systems and technologies to accomplish the business goals of the enterprise. Many practicing enterprise architects argue this is not the primary purpose of EA, but I believe it is. In fact, this purpose is the historic reason for the EA practice (i.e., the reason that EA came into existence). Whether you believe this premise or not, this is the viewpoint of this paper. As enterprise architects, we're responsible for the design of the enterprise and the design must include information technology (IT) or your enterprise design is incomplete. When I say align, I mean to synergize or optimize the people, processes, information flows and systems to accomplish the business needs of the enterprise to achieve the desired effects or outcomes. Many architects view this approach as being too IT centric, but it's not - rather, IT is included as a part of the whole due to its large influence on enterprise outcomes. Our UML approach is very interface focused, provides operational context (business process), and identifies information flows between business roles where enterprise systems are also treated as roles to identify important business interface needs. I characterize outcomes in the form of capabilities - sometimes referred to as business services. Throughout this paper I'll hyperlink you to various definitions to enhance our mutual understanding on this EA topic. I recommend right-clicking on the figures to open the image in a new window to follow the discussion with the figure in view.</p>

<p>I consider <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#capability">capability</a> the highest level of an enterprise architecture, the purpose of the architecture and the foundational description the architecture is trying to improve or create. In fact, I frequently use capability as the &quot;subject&quot; in our use case models, which I'll explain later. Most organizations have many capabilities and the architecture staff is typically unable to accomplish everything all once; therefore, through some form of governance, the organization needs to prioritize architecture engagements in the most effective way. I'll discuss how to recognize architecture priorities; however, it's not the purpose of this paper to discuss architecture governance. You can find governance related discussion in our <a href="/austinea/roadmap/">COA EA Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" id="profile">UML Profile Extension for Enterprise Architecture</p>

<p>I recommend the architecture employ a UML profile extension for enterprise architecture. This extension exists for most popular UML tools and are available because of an initiative by the US Department of Defense (DoD) and UK Ministry of Defence (MOD). If you're a civilian or commercial organization, don't let the DoD/MOD source concern you, because EA is EA no matter how you slice it or dice it. Defense has exactly the same challenges as industry - aligning their information systems to the desired outcomes of their enterprise. In their situation, exercising military power throughout the globe. The DoD/MOD wisely recognized their Architecture Frameworks provided great guidance and definition of a good EA practice, but lacked a definitive method of execution - not only a method, but &quot;standard&quot; architecture data to allow sharing of EA information among dissimilar tools and enterprises. To accomplish this endeavor, the DoD and MOD coordinated with the <a href="http://www.omg.org">Object Management Group (OMG)</a> to accomplish a ground breaking feet - standardize an EA profile to ensure consistency of architectures throughout the defense departments. As a result, the OMG, in collaboration with various tool vendors and industry architecture experts, established the <a href="http://www.omg.org/updm/index.htm">Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM)</a>. The profile combines the UML, System Modeling Language (SysML) and the Service Oriented Modeling Language (SOAML) into a unified approach to EA service delivery. Meaning, &quot;one&quot; framework to accomplish the enterprise analysis while delivering comprehensive, clearly understood business needs to develop effective solution architectures. In my opinion, this is an impressive accomplishment! Someday, I hope industry can do the same... In the meantime, I'm content using the UPDM.</p>

<p>This paper is not going to discuss the entire end-to-end solution, because this would require a book or even multiple books. Therefore, I'm going to focus my discussion on the enterprise architecture, which employs only the UML portion of the UPDM. This paper is not about architecture frameworks; rather, this paper discusses &quot;how&quot; one uses the UML to create a successful enterprise architecture practice to implement your favorite framework. I suspect this approach would work for The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) as well - I'd be surprised if it didn't. I've shown this approach to John Zachman and he concurs that our UML approach traverses many of the prescribed layers in the <a href="http://www.zachman.com/">Zachman Framework</a>. By the way, I recognize that a comprehensive EA requires more than UML models. There are other elements of a successful EA practice such as a Technical Reference Model (TRM), Application Portfolio, etc. requiring different models or tools for which the UML is not well suited. For example, you may use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) because it provides constructs for execution languages - in particular, Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). However, the BPMN approach lacks an &laquo;interface&raquo; modeled component - in that, interfaces are implied rather than explicit as represented by the UML. The interface viewpoint, in my opinion, provides much greater EA value. Therefore, the enterprise may consider using both UML and BPMN depending on the purpose. In the end, there's no perfect solution, so I'm going to address the UML portion of enterprise modeling for the purpose of analysis and design, which is a significant EA value.</p>

<p>The UML is an object-oriented language and employs similar principles used by the software industry; however, UPDM stereotypes allow the architect to abstract UML constructs to the business layer of the enterprise. When applied properly, the architect uses <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#ooad">object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)</a> concepts to describe complex relationships. However, our models largely capture the business user experience of the enterprise in the form of Business Use Case Specifications - the foundational element of the UML. Let's get started - where does the enterprise architect begin?</p>

<p>This paper is not a lesson on the UML or UPDM. There's plenty of other resources to obtain this knowledge. However, even if you don't know the UML/UPDM, this paper can provide insight into important relationships for a successful EA practice - particularly, if you're interested in aligning your IT services to important business outcomes. Let's face it, EA is not a simple endeavor no matter the method or tool you use. Depending on the size and scope of your organization, I wouldn't expect any hero-saving, miraculous findings coming out of your UML EA for a couple of years. Albeit, if you thoroughly study and understand the principles in this paper and have good leadership support, you might succeed much sooner. I find the largest challenge is obtaining the business leaders audience to pick their brains on what's important to their portion of the enterprise. However, when these opportunities present themselves, I usually begin by building what I call Capability Area Architecture (CAA).</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" id="caa">Capability Area Architecture</p>

<p>The CAA concept is actually quite simple (<a href="/austinea/whitepaper/uMLEAStrategy/vision.jpg">Figure 4</a>). An enterprise has a vision, in our case, become the best managed city in the nation. We do this through optimal and efficient delivery of goods and services to our citizens. In the figure you'll notice that I labeled capabilities in the form of outcomes (purposely left out the verb and focused on the noun) - this is to make an important point. A capability &quot;always&quot; delivers an important outcome or it's not a capability, which may also be referred to as a business <a href="/austinea/definition/#service">service</a>. In our architectures, we refer to service and capability as the same thing, because they both produce an outcome or benefit (according to the dictionary definition). One might think of a service when you see the UPDM stereotype capability in our examples. The purpose is to examine the business capabilities and identify important business goals to either create a capability that doesn't exist or improve an existing capability. The purpose of the enterprise capability/goal relationship is two-fold. The architect is looking for common capabilities and shared goals across the enterprise. Because the architectural challenges are usually large, it's important to identify maximum value opportunities for the architect to focus their attention and analysis. One can easily infer that a common capability implies a common process, common infrastructure, and common data - or at least it should because it produces the same outcome! This top down - bottom up approach (as I call it) provides decision-makers and architects a way to agree on significant architecture initiatives - i.e., the ones that produce the greatest value to the enterprise.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-indent: .2in;" id="service">- Meaning of Service within Architecture</p>

<p>I view a service as a triggered event that stimulates an encapsulated <a href="/austinea/definition/#behavior">behavior</a> that returns an expected result of value. Services scale various levels of abstraction from humans or systems stimulating results driven process to a software component invoking an operation on another component interface for a particular valued response. Service-oriented architectures ensure each layer of abstraction is properly insulted from the layer above it and below it to allow for behavior improvement, replacement or simulation without disrupting the enterprise capability as a whole. Consider capability a 'type' of business service - whose behavior (people, processes and technologies) collectively produce some desired effect, important result or desired outcome for stakeholders. Missions contain a collection of capabilities to accomplish a desired organizational purpose to achieve the targeted vision. We set goals and objectives on capabilities to amplify or guide capability improvement or development toward the vision. Goals and their dependencies establish our sequencing plan sometimes referred as a roadmap.

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-indent: .2in;" id="bmm">- Comparison with Business Motivation Model</p>

<p>Some may confuse this approach as a deviation from the principles of Business Motivation Model (BMM), but they are not in competition with each other. In fact, using UPDM the architect can apply similar BMM principles. For example, capability could represent the BMM Desired Result (with goals and objectives) and the UML Use Case Model could represent the BMM Course of Action (with strategy and tactic). Once you've become familiar with UPDM, you'll discover many similarities in their approach. If you're successful at BMM, I'd view UML/UPDM as complementary in its ability to realize the solution while demonstrating how tactics and goals are successfully accomplished. If you're not using BMM, UPDM provides many similar principles useful to the enterprise architect as explained later (but not compared to BMM). The associations may be somewhat different, but the outcome is the same.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-indent: .2in;" id="orgcaa">- The Organizational Domain CAA</p>

<p>Select the diagram (<a href="/austinea/arch/realEstate/report/realEstateVision.jpg">Figure 5</a>) to enlarge for a more readable view - I'll use this diagram for further discussion. The CAA provides the architect with an understanding of what the enterprise is all about, the important outcomes the enterprise is trying to accomplish and the goals various organizational domains of the enterprise are trying to accomplish. The UPDM includes <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#vision">vision</a> and <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#mission">mission</a> stereotypes as well, which I find useful in the architecture-scoping phase. The architect facilitates this conversation and the collaboration is enlightening, informative and valuable in providing the architect a comprehensive understanding the business stakeholder challenges and needs. The exercise of creating these models provides the architect a good picture of the overall enterprise challenges and the relationship (UML/UPDM associations - ex., &laquo;depends on&raquo;, &laquo;part of&raquo;, etc.) between capabilities and goals. You don't immediately build the CAA as shown in <a href="/austinea/image/essentialCapabilities.jpg">Figure 2</a>, which provides a comprehensive enterprise picture; rather, the architect builds individual CAA models for each organizational domain and assembles them when a representative set of CAAs are available. Depending on the size and established boundaries of your enterprise, you don't necessarily need the &quot;entire&quot; enterprise CAA views to be successful; rather, enough CAAs to begin to observe the patterns of business goals, which I'll explain later.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The CAA is the highest level of the model that the architect uses to understand the important outcomes of a particular business domain. By the way, when I say highest, I mean the highest organizational domain viewpoint of the goods and services delivered by the domain's mission. This becomes a building block for a more comprehensive understanding leading to the enterprise CAA. A trick I sometimes use to facilitate the collaboration is to start with a &quot;black box&quot; view of the organization to facilitate the stakeholder understanding of their customer environment (the stakeholders whom the enterprise provides services). I ask business domain experts to explain who their business stakeholders are (typically in the form of roles) and begin to identify important outcomes the business domain is responsible to deliver. When developing the capability name, the outcome is clearly identifiable using a verb/noun vernacular such as Provide (verb) Clean Water (noun) where clean water is the outcome.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I don't have an example of the Real Estate Office to tie these ideas together, because a skilled architect will not always use this technique - for example, I sometimes skip the &quot;black box&quot; domain view and jump strait to the CAA. Some domains are able to understand the capability (service) idea up front. This is an important skill the architect must achieve - the ability to know when certain EA methods facilitate your particular audience. The example (<a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eim/customerFacing.jpg">Figure 6</a>) is one I used to help our Enterprise Infrastructure Management group define their &quot;value viewpoint&quot; to understand their customer service relationship. I call these diagrams the Value Viewpoint because they emphasize the organization's value to the stakeholders they service. The idea is to use this customer-focused viewpoint to realign the organization's service delivery model. To learn more about this concept, follow the link to the <a href="/austinea/whitepaper/uMLEAStrategy/valueViewpoint.html">Value Viewpoint</a>. Next, I'll explain how to identify enterprise common IT capabilities, which requires a significant amount of experience and skill.</p>

<p>Enterprise architecture needs are typically greater than the available skilled architecture staff; therefore, the organization must choose their architecture engagements wisely. CAAs are no-brainers - you must create them. Depending on the complexity and size of your enterprise, CAAs can take a very long time - mostly because it's difficult to get domain business users together to perform the collaboration and the architect usually only gets a couple hours of their time each week - if you're lucky. Depending on the kinds of goods and services your enterprise is responsible for, you don't require a complete (total) set of CAAs to begin to recognize the goal &quot;patterns&quot; the enterprise is trying to accomplish. The CAA example above (<a href="/austinea/image/essentialCapabilities.jpg">Figure 2</a>) only provides CAAs for seven departments and one from the CIO Council, which I include as an example to align IT goals to the enterprise business needs. The view, although not complete, is enough to observe the goal patterns of the enterprise. This is possible because the departments share similar &quot;types&quot; of outcomes. What I'm referring to are shared goals - goals that are common or similar in nature to the enterprise whether they're information technology (IT) related or not. I tend to emphasize IT related goals and let the business user concern themselves with non-IT (operational) goals once identified. Architects could assist in non-IT goals; however, with limited architect resources, IT service delivery is usually a wiser investment strategy. Through analysis using the &quot;human computer&quot; called the brain, the architect applies their information technology knowledge, skills and abilities to recognize (i.e., see the forest through the trees) Common IT Capabilities to facilitate the business goals of the enterprise. The UML dependencies between the Common IT Capability and the business goals allows the architect to align the business story (i.e., goal enhances or creates capability) with the IT story (i.e., IT service aids goal success) through a shared understanding of the business goal - i.e., if this is the IT business goal, what IT services best aid in achieving it?</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 7: Common IT Capabilities</span>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Identifying Common IT Capabilities is instrumental in aligning your information technology services to the business needs of the enterprise. What common capabilities provide is a horizontal solution fulfilling the enterprise needs - i.e., the IT capabilities business users consider common or essential to business delivery. Common capabilities provide a point of focus for information technology services - i.e., the &quot;kinds&quot; of IT services needed by the enterprise. A responsible IT shop redefines their service delivery model to ensure they're delivering these capabilities &quot;exceptionally well&quot; and use this information to normalize the IT infrastructure to ensure maximum performance of these delivered IT services. This concept indicates EA has a role in service management, because EA CAAs define and align the service delivery model to ensure common capabilities are delivering the value as discussed in the <a href="/austinea/whitepaper/uMLEAstrategy/valueViewpoint.html">Value Viewpoint</a>.</p>
 
<p>The ability to recognize and identify common capability needs is what you're looking for in a good enterprise architect - i.e., the ability to see &quot;the forest through the trees.&quot; I believe this is why an enterprise architect requires a strong system engineering background such as knowledge and skills to deliver large scale information systems. According to Wikipedia, important skills and knowledge include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems thinking - the ability to see how parts interact with the whole (big picture thinking)
<li>Knowledge of the business for which the enterprise architecture is being developed
<li>Interpersonal and leadership skills - servant leadership, collaboration, facilitation, and negotiation skills
<li>Communication skills, both written and spoken
<li>Ability to explain complex technical issues in a way that non-technical people may understand
<li>Knowledge of IT governance and operations
<li>Comprehensive knowledge of systems engineering
</ul>

<p>After more than 14 years of building EAs, I'm in complete agreement with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architect">Wikipedia's skills assessment</a>, because enterprise architects need to be strategic, abstract thinkers, employ system engineering and have comprehensive information technology knowledge. In fact, that's why good enterprise architects are hard to find. Most technically skilled individuals do not pursue highly collaborative, interpersonal and writing  strategy development activities. From my experience, most IT folks specialize in the solution space and rarely move away from this comfort zone. In fact, most organizations claim they're doing enterprise architecture, but at best they're teetering on the edges of EA. This is evidenced by the job descriptions found on the Internet soliciting for EA positions. Most of the job descriptions describe the skills and abilities of a solution architect, rather than the skills and abilities to strategically align information technology - this indicates many companies are unaware of what EA actually is (at least by my definition of EA). Due to the technical system think nature of EA, I believe most organizations align their enterprise architects with the CIO. When in reality, the EA is more the arm of business than IT - an EA should be how business tells IT what's needed in understandable terms. The enterprise architect uses the UML to provide the business translation to solution providers, then shepherds an agreeable solution using the EA as a blueprint.</p>

<p>I like Wiki's reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership">servant leadership</a>, because an enterprise architect rarely has any official authority; rather, they are influencers, they lead by example, and are sought for the value of their service. This means the enterprise architect requires good people skills. Not to mention the fact that your Chief Enterprise Architect needs to have great marketing and advocacy skills, otherwise there's no hope for your EA to survive! I'm often reminded of Robin Williams in his role as the android Andrew in the film Bicentennial Man, who frequently states, "One is glad to be of service." In fact, done correctly, your EA program can perform the role of customer relationship management, because the EA ensures clear guidance on the expected outcomes. A good EA can tell the business story in a realizable way.</p>

<p>If you study the CAA diagram above (<a href="/austinea/image/essentialCapabilities.jpg">Figure 2</a>), under the Transportation department capability model, you'll notice the goal <i>Greater ability to perform analysis</i> has a large concentration of arrows (UML dependencies). This indicates this goal is extremely important to many of Transportation's capabilities - the circuit board of lines between capabilities and goals isn't important! What's important is the concentration of dependencies on the goal. Again, if you look closely, you'll observe that this goal &laquo;depends on&raquo; the goal to <i>Obtain electronic review solution</i>. This goal contributes to Transportation's capability to strategically plan, regulate right of way, and regulate special events, which is currently accomplished by a paper-plan regulatory review by city staff. An electronic means to review and comment on plans provides greater efficiencies and the ability to store documents with meta-data for subsequent retrieval - rather than chasing down paper, which sometimes gets filed away in a place we call iron mountain and takes forever to retrieve historically filed documents. Further study of the CAA reveals the goal <i>Obtain electronic review solution</i> is shared by Planning &amp; Development Review and Public Works departments (find them on <a href="/austinea/arch/essentialCapabilities.jpg">Figure 2</a> to ensure your tracking the story). Later we've learned that other departments share this goal as well. Therefore, this is a significant and shared goal! Even though this goal doesn't have a large concentration on it, the goal is important to provide the meta-data necessary for the goal <i>Greater ability to perform analysis</i> because it provides the meta-data needed to research and find relevant plans for future planning and analysis. I'll discuss the development of the business requirements to accomplish this goal specifically later in the paper.</p>

<p>The CAA tells a story, a story about the enterprise and the relationship between the business goals. Because the architect participates in its creation, they become extremely knowledgeable regarding the enterprise needs and able to use the model to &quot;understand&quot; the story and &quot;tell&quot; the story to others, such as financial decision-makers not connected to the problem. Currently, city building and land use plans (blueprints) are coordinated with the city on paper, marked up by hand, and manually entered into information systems for Submittal Applicant feedback regarding regulatory compliance for resubmittal until compliance is approved. Using the CAA model, it became clear to city leadership that we need to fix this problem and pursue the <i>Obtain electronic review solution</i> goal to enable the more important goal <i>Greater ability to perform analysis</i>. If you're tracking with me, this is really important stuff! The model provides clear enterprise understanding as you pursue business solutions using a Business Use Case Model (discussed later).</p>

<p>On further inspection of the CAA, you'll observe the <i>Obtain electronic review solution</i> goal maps to the <i>Manage Case Files</i> a common IT capability. It's not clear in the diagram (too many traces), however, our UML tool provides a &quot;layering&quot; feature to allow the architect to turn off other common capability layers to observe the trace under inspection. Typically, the Manage Case Files service manager is responsible to manage the solution. This is where traditional roles become a bit blurred - in a typical organization the requirements collection is the responsibility of the service manager. However, if you have a good EA program, your EA staff uses UML/UPDM use cases to collaborate with business users and develop the requirements. In essence your EA provides, at least in part, a service management role to align and define services as well as business requirements collection.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 8: Business Logical Data Model</span>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I consider the logical data model (LDM) as an optional way to communicate with the business user (<a href="/austinea/arch/awu/mobility/aWULDM.jpg">Figure 8</a>). This is another architecture skill similar to the Value Viewpoint discussed earlier - you need to know when this approach is useful. For some business users this is a great way to start to understand their process. We examine important business information elements and their relationships. Sometimes, we'll capture high-level, important attributes as well. By using familiar information elements from their business process, this gets your business user comfortable with architecture elements. Later, the architect uses the LDM information elements as part of your <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#sequence_diagram">UML Sequence Diagrams</a> that I'll discuss next and this activity prepares the business user with the architecture artifacts for the work ahead.</p>

<p>We elicit the business user to discuss important information elements they use in their day-to-day activities and begin to understand their relationships. Information elements may include paper forms, reports, data entries that occur in their existing systems, etc. - depending on the operational context. Like other model activities, the LDM is developed iteratively and you revisit the LDM regularly throughout the Business Use Case development as you determine and discover new information elements and others get deleted when not needed. I've witnessed business users spend a great deal of time working on their LDM, sometimes in great detail. Solution providers find the LDMs very useful in their understanding of the business need as well, so it's a great architecture artifact to have. However, sooner or later, you need to get them on the task at hand - develop the Business Use Case Model.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" id="usecase">Business Use Case Model</p>

<p>The Business Use Case Model is the heavy lifting part of any good UML/UPDM EA practice. These models document the roles (both people and systems), process, information flow, and business rules to achieve the desired result of value (ROV). In fact, when we train new architects this is where we begin - we teach our apprentice enterprise architects to develop quality UML <a href="/austinea/definition/#use_case">use case</a> models. As they gain experience, later in their career, we introduce strategic viewpoints such as the CAA - although, they are taught to be familiar with the strategic nature of the CAA and its applicability to their use case development. We don't teach them the traditional approach in use case development, rather we've modified our technique based on our understanding of the UPDM method. Fundamentally, the approach is the same - i.e., ROV is still important. What's different about a UPDM use case model is that we don't show dialog between system (physical) and software components (logical) using traditional UML techniques. Instead, we abstract our use case models up a notch and use the capability as the &quot;subject&quot; system. For more information refer to <a href="/austinea/whitepaper/UseCaseModel/">Anatomy of the Use Case</a>.</p>

<p>If you select to enlarge the diagram <a href="/austinea/image/performRegulatoryReview.jpg">Figure 9</a> - Business Use Case Model, you'll see the use case in the upper left corner. You can also view this use case model in a more traditional form by following the link to <a href="/austinea/arch/pdr/performRegulatoryReview/">Perform Regulatory Review</a>. We create our use case models from the business user viewpoint without dictating a solution. In fact, we sometimes refer to these use case views as the User Experience Viewpoint. Based on our identified goal to <i>Obtain electronic review solution</i>, further analysis of the CAA revealed that Perform Regulatory Review is the primary capability (the container class of the process) - also shared by other city departments. As an important point, let me deviate my thought a bit and explore an interesting topic - caution, I get a little technical in this discussion.</p>

<p>In UML architecture speak, I view capabilities as class representations of process. They act as containers of roles (people and systems), process, information flow, and business rules and represent a &quot;type&quot; of process - meaning that a capability typically have more than one process that &quot;exercise&quot; the capability - in essence, as a capability stereotyped &quot;class,&quot; they contain business operations (UML messages) exercised by the use case defined process (sequence diagram) demonstrating the information flow (object in the signature of the message) between the roles (either people or systems). Therefore, stated in another way, the capability as the &quot;subject system&quot; consumes and produces UML messages between roles to exercise the process defined by its UPDM use case. That might have been hard to follow, but the UML ties all the enterprise parts together nicely and this is an important skill to master!</p>

<p>In my example, this capability has just one UML use case process - i.e., Perform Regulatory Review. So technically, the capability is not actually a capability at all; rather it's a process - this happens all the time because the architect is not always familiar with the business domain being modeled, but this is okay... Because capabilities produce important outcomes and use cases produce results of value, it's easy to get them confused. Later as your model matures, you explore other maturing processes and begin to map your use case models to a new, redefined capability - the new capability changes to <i>Ensure Regulatory Compliance</i>, because the purpose of the overall capability provides the service for the Submittal Applicant to legally occupy the building or use the land as intended (the actual important outcome) - this expands the scope of the capability definition. This is the iterative nature of the architecture method (i.e., you architect a little, learn a lot, architect some more, learn even more) leading to a well-defined understanding of your enterprise capabilities. This is a distinct advantage of object-oriented modeling. Changes are moderately easy - even big changes. Change it once and it changes everywhere it's used in your architecture - you gota' like that! I do... The change I suggested here only takes a few minutes, but I like to mature a few more use cases with the business user first. You can observe this update at <a href="/austinea/arch/pdr/">Planning and Development Review Use Case Models</a>. This architecture process is quite revealing to both the architect and the business user. I've had business customer's thank me for helping them think through their value viewpoints - let alone the value of the business use case itself.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 9: Business Use Case Model</span>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The use case diagram's primary purpose is as a scoping mechanism (shown in upper left hand corner of the Business Use Case Model - <a href="/austinea/image/performRegulatoryReview.jpg">Figure 9</a>). Using this model, the architect collaborates with the business user to understand the various roles and enterprise systems requiring some form of interface to develop the use case scope. Again, the process is iterative. You might construct an incomplete use case diagram and begin developing your activity view and your sequence diagrams to explore the required interfaces to document the process. This may lead to newly discovered roles and a better-defined scope. The activity model captures the business rules in the form of an interaction overview. Notice that the activity model (interaction overview - upper right corner of diagram) is a little different from the traditional activity diagrams typically developed by business systems analysts. They include objects (information elements shown in green) and show their flow through the process. Additionally, they capture the high level business rules - notice that the activity model does not use the traditional (yes/no) at decision points; rather, they explicitly identify the condition or state as objects move through the process. These states add improved understanding - not to mention the fact that decisions may not be binary (i.e., there might be more than two decisions). You'll also note that the activities on the interaction overview expand to expose the sequence diagram view. Each activity has its own sequence diagram - hence the term interaction overview, because they convey the interaction of sequence diagrams - look around <a href="/austinea/image/performRegulatoryReview.jpg">Figure 9</a> and you'll see the sequence diagrams. In the UML tool, the architect clicks on the business activity and the sequence diagram automatically opens. This approach uses an information-hiding concept in that each &quot;layer&quot; reveals more and more detail until you begin to describe the user experience as they use the capability as a subject - in this case, Perform Regulatory Review (process) emerging to Ensure Regulatory Compliance (capability).</p>

<p>Some architects believe that this is a system or solution architecture - it's not! It's the business use viewpoint owned by business users and facilitated by architects. I believe this confusion comes from the fact that we identify system interface needs - in our example you'll see an interface to our enterprise document imaging and management system (EDIMS). This is simply the business user indicating they wish to store the document (object) in EDIMS, but it doesn't say how! The &quot;how&quot; should be accomplished by the solution provider. We accomplish sequence diagrams by examining the capability as a &quot;black Box&quot; - i.e., the subject system. If you further inspect the diagram, you notice messages (horizontal lines with arrows) on the sequence diagram - their description/definition is shown in a table. In the UML model, this description is contained in the documentation of the message (i.e., the operation of the class Perform Regulatory Review - UPDM stereotyped as capability). This is where the business user explains how they wish to use the system. We have our business users explain the use as the &quot;system&quot; instead of the capability name. Because of the iterative nature of the process, you may later change the name of your capability as I described earlier. If you used the capability name in the specifications, you would need to edit all of your capability descriptions if it changes. So it's best to just say the user uses &quot;the system to... bla, bla&quot; in your specifications. Look at the <i>performIntake</i> message on the Perform Intake sequence diagram. There you'll see a description (i.e., business functional need) on how the business user desires the dialog between the role (i.e., Submittal Applicant) and the subject system (i.e., capability) to occur. We sometimes include business performance needs in these functional descriptions as well.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-indent: .2in;" id="interface">- Managing Interfaces</p>

<p>I'm not going to elaborate too much on this subject; however, this is worthy of a short discussion. Because the operations (messages on the sequence diagram) of the capability class essentially represent an interface, they begin to expose potential reusable <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#behavior">behavior</a> or operational patterns of the enterprise. When business modeling with implied interfaces using techniques such as BPMN, the likeliness of discovering or identifying reusable interfaces is greatly diminished and the earlier they are discovered, the better. Also, the interface nature of the UML provides a more realistic approach to identify and manage risk, which typically occurs at an interface. Finally, as your model matures to a solution architecture, interfaces can be regrouped into interface specifications leading to a well thought through service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework, which is not possible using BPMN because there are no interface components to manage! Today's business is orchestrated through optimal interface solutions, so why would you architect a solution that lacks an interface architectural component?</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" id="summary">Summary</p>

<p>In the beginning, you'll discover that the business user is a little confused on how the UML process works, because most business users rarely experienced this approach to develop requirements. However, trust me, they catch on &quot;quickly&quot; and you'll observe them in open collaboration! The communication line opens as they debate back and forth. I sometimes just sit back and enjoy watching the business users settle on a conclusion and they always do. When you have been doing this a long time, it's very rewarding to watch the business user reach this state, because it means they took ownership of the process (and the architecture) to reach agreed positions.</p>

<p>I know many of you feel this approach may be too difficult to successfully employ and I'm not suggesting this is easy - albeit, it gets easier as you gain experience. Some architects may find that they're highly successful at loading certain types of EA information into some proprietary tool that does the &quot;analysis&quot; for them - as some vendors advertise. I call these tools the magic funnel - pour in all your requirements and the funnel automatically arranges your enterprise business needs. However, this is not reality - enterprise analysis is a complicated endeavor requiring human system engineering skills to develop effective designs. Tools, such as the UML, only assist in this endeavor. Others may believe the approach we're using isn't EA at all - at least their version of EA. But what's important to us is our enterprise architecture (or whatever you want to call it) influences real change in our enterprise by delivering business needs that inform solutions providers how business users think! In another paper, I plan to publish, I'll explain how you to recognize &quot;patterns&quot; of reusable interfaces in your business model leading to horizontal integration - these are already beginning to emerge in our EA. We've also included our Business Use Case Models as the functional specifications in our request for proposals (RFP) when outsourcing our solutions - we've received glowing vendor feedback. Contracting once asked me, &quot;What do we do if a vendor doesn't understand our UML RFP submissions?&quot; The answer to this question was easy - they are incompetent, so don't hire them!</p>
