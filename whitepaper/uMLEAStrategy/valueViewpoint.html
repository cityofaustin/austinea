<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">The UML Value Viewpoint</p>

<p>Enterprise architecture's principle is to explore various entities either systems or organizations using a &quot;black-box&quot; approach. The purpose of this approach is to understand and examine the value or the important outcome of the box. By examining the architecture from this viewpoint, important outcomes become foremost increasing clarity to the purpose or reason to make improvements by setting goals measured by objectives. Because we're working toward a more customer facing organization, it's useful to clearly understand how our service delivery model influences our customers. That's what this architecture exercise is all about.</p>

<p>Shown on the figure below (select to enlarge in your browser), is the value model developed during an architecture session. The people stereotype (three actors grouped together) represent stakeholders in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM) framework we're using. Using Enterprise Infrastructure Management (EIM) organizational resource, the value items are shown on the directed association between the organizational resource and the stakeholder such as Internet for public access, direct IT service, consulting leadership, etc. along with the definitions we created between each association. Using this black-box model, we created a customer facing service delivery model - shown as a <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#capability">capability</a> class. By definition, there's not much difference between a capability and a service.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>capability</b> - People, processes and systems delivering value for a specific purpose. The quality of being capable; to have the capacity or ability to do something, achieve specific effects or declared goals and objectives.
<li><b>service</b> - A system or organization that provides people with something that they need. A body of people who carry out work for the public benefit within an organization run by local or national government.
</ul>

<p>UPDM uses capability to represent what we might traditionally refer to as a service. Because capability is more about declaring goals and objectives, this is a better abstraction for our use. The reason we model this way is because a service from an IT viewpoint more closely represents a method or operation commonly used by programmers. Therefore, the UPDM community chose to refer to the business side as capability.

<tr><th>Customer Service</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Risk Assessment and Total Cost of Ownership for New and Improved Infrastructure Capabilities</td>
<td>Provide city governance entities such as CIO Council (CIOC), Department Directors Advisory Council (DDAC), and IT Steering Committee (ITSC) budgeting, total cost of ownership, cost value, risk mitigation, and other programmatic elements relevant to new and improved infrastructure capabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Infrastructure Services</td>
<td>Provide platform and infrastructure as a service, authentication (such as Federated authentication infrastructure), IT security, integrated system architecture, voice over Internet Protocol (VIOP), analog voice services, business continuity, email, badging, fax services, configuration management, open source tooling, IT hardware, data center operations (storage, servers, and virtualization), and networking.</td>

<td>Recommend Operational Efficiencies</td>
<td>Recommend infrastructure operational efficiencies to include Citywide standardization, economies of scale, and best practice guidance.</td>

<tr>
<td>Provide Consulting Leadership</td>
<td>Provide consulting services to establish process with other departments, scheduling, asset management, vendor coordination, PC imaging, PC refresh, standardization, budgeting (costing), financial allocation, life cycle management, security governance model, Citywide IT infrastructure, contract coordination, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deliver End-Point Infrastructure Support</td>
<td>Assists city employees with IT infrastructure support needs to include desktop anomalies. This service is typically triggered through the service desk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Direct IT Service</td>
<td>Mayor and Council represent important leadership roles here at the City and require special attention as they respond to citizen needs. Therefore, special care is provided to ensure that IT services are meeting their needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Respond to Public Information Requests</td>
<td>Through the policy of open government, Mayor and Council sometimes are requested to deliver public information to its citizens. This service provides policies and procedures to gather the requested information and deliver it Mayor and Council per their request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Internet for Public Access</td>
<td>Provides Internet services throughout our City (mostly in City owned property) such as COA Mesh and Internet access points at City Hall where the public may freely access the Internet.</td>

<p>Our next activity involves Enterprise Infrastructure Management's service catalog. We examine each of them and rewrite/reorient them to emphasize the important outcome they provide. We might add, remove or change some of these elements as well. Once our service model is outcome focused, it'll be much easier to establish a directed association (depends on relationship) between the customer facing capability and the service delivery element. After we map our service delivery model, we'll discover and understand important service catalog items (ones with many associations) as they relate to the customer facing capability. Because these services represent an important relationship, we can set goals and objectives and create <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#sequencing_plan">Sequencing Plan</a> to place action on the goal.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>goal</b> - A desired result a person or a system envisions, plans and commits to achieve. A desired end-point in some sort of assumed development. Many people endeavor to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines (a milestone). Goals amplify and quantify the organization's Vision.
<li><b>objective</b> - Quantifies a goal - a performance measure of behavior.
</ul>

<p>The figure above represents a simple example of what a concentrated association might look like. These concentrations will lead to concerted discussions on how we might improve the service supporting our customer facing service delivery model. This all may seem a bit confusing at this point; however, I'm certain you'll catch on as we move forward. Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>
