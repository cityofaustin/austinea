<p>I'm going to make the case that an Enterprise Architecture (EA) <a href="../UseCaseModel/index.html" target="definition">Use Case Model</a> has the potential to become our requirements management process. Please start by viewing this <a href="http://youtu.be/4a4ZxOAQifE" target="definition">IAG Presentation</a>. This presentation summarizes very well the challenges when dealing with complexity and requirements capture. The video is very good and entertaining!

<p>Most projects fail because they lack a solid business case, under estimate complexity, lack management controls and most importantly do not gather good user input. These are all symptoms on why projects fail to gain and maintain momentum. What an EA provides is the critical mass of understanding necessary to maintain a project's momentum. It's critical that we understand the business need and vet these needs through our business partners, which is impossible to do using data. This is why database-oriented requirements management tools typically fail to achieve the desired results - they fail to maintain critical mass. The real value of enterprise modeling is the ability to visually collaborate and think through the requirements with stakeholders; thereby, achieving an "understandable" agreement on outcome, process, function and performance.

<p>Modeling requirements is a proven method to achieve good results; therefore, significantly increasing the opportunity for a project's success. A critical step in the development of an architecture-centric approach to requirements management was taken on by the Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework Working Group (AFWG) when it defined standardized architecture representations across the DoD. This is where our <a href="../../definition/index.html#rsa" target="definition">IBM Rational Software Architect (RSA)</a> tool's <a href="../../definition/index.html#upia" target="definition">UML Profile-Based Integrated Architecture (UPIA)</a> came from. In doing so, the AFWG succeeded in providing stakeholders a better means of achieving interoperability and integration by identifying and addressing inter- and intra-enterprise dependencies. Today, the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Version 2.0, embraces the use of a common approach for representing DoD architectures. The DoDAF approach enables architecture descriptions to be shared across military Joint and Combined organizations, which could just as easily apply across various city departments. In fact, the need for model driven architecture was the primary reason that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" target="definition">Unified Modeling Language (UML)</a> was created in the first place. In the future, our UML enterprise model could have a significant role in our requirements management process.

<p>Our citywide enterprise architecture model could become our "technical" portfolio management tool and serve as part of our <a href="../../definition/index.html#knowledge_management" target="definition">Service Knowledge Management System</a>. Using UML and UPIA, the RSA tool provides the Presentation, Knowledge Processing, and Information Integration layers of our ITIL model - this is certainly true as it relates to the modeled capabilities. The UPIA provides a capability viewpoint, which for all practical purposes can be viewed as a service knowledge management layer important to citywide strategic planning.

<p>Let's begin this journey together. For a year or so there'll be many logistical challenges as we tool and train while simultaneously keeping up with our existing work load. As you observed from the video, most of you are very aware of what doesn't work and you happily shared that knowledge with me. Let me share with you a process that does work! Once we obtain this new understanding, we can evolve to an infrastructure that makes the City of Austin the best managed city. This I know for certain...
