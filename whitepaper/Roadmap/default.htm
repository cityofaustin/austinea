<h1 id="es">Executive Summary</h1>

<p>An enterprise architecture (EA) establishes the agency-wide roadmap to achieve an agency's mission through optimal performance of its core business processes within an efficient information technology (IT) environment. Simply stated, enterprise architectures are &quot;blueprints&quot; for systematically defining an organization's current (baseline) or desired (target) environment. Enterprise architectures are essential for evolving information systems and developing new systems that optimize their mission value. This is accomplished in logical or business terms (e.g., mission, business functions, information flows, and system environments) and technical terms (e.g., software, hardware, communications), and includes a Sequencing Plan for transitioning from the baseline environment to the target environment.

<p>If defined, maintained, and implemented effectively, these institutional blueprints assist in optimizing the interdependencies and interrelationships among an organization's business operations and the underlying IT that support the mission. Experience has shown that without a complete and enforced EA, agencies run the risk of buying and building systems that are duplicative, incompatible, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and integrate.

<p>For EAs to be useful and provide business value, their development, maintenance, and implementation should be managed effectively. This step-by-step process guide is intended to assist the City of Austin in defining, maintaining, and implementing an EA program by providing a disciplined and rigorous approach to EA life cycle management. It describes major EA program management areas, beginning with suggested organizational structure and management controls, a process for development of a baseline and target architecture, and development of a Sequencing Plan. This guide also describes EA maintenance and implementation, as well as oversight and control. Collectively, these areas provide a recommended model for effective EA management.

<p>Enterprise Architecture offers a promising opportunity for the City of Austin (COA). In fact, EA should be viewed as an innovation. EA is the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and improving the key requirements, principles, and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution and transformation. The transformation process entails the analysis and design of an enterprise in its current and future states from a strategic, organizational, and technological perspective. That being said, however, EA is a very complex endeavor requiring leadership support for success.

<h1 id="need">The Need for this Guide</h1>

<p>While the COA EA team has a successful framework and their EA processes provide valuable guidance on the content of enterprise architectures, there is literally no guidance how to successfully manage the process of creating, changing, and using the enterprise architecture. Therefore, this guidance is crucially important. Without successful implementation of this roadmap, it is highly unlikely that the City can successfully produce a complete and enforceable EA for optimizing its IT systems business value and mission performance. For example, effective development of a complete EA needs corporate commitment with senior management sponsorship. The enterprise architecture development should be managed as a formal project by an organizational entity that is held accountable for success. Since the EA facilitates change based upon the changing business environment of the organization, the architect is the organization's primary change agent. Effective implementation requires establishment of system compliance with the architecture, as well as continuous assessment and enforcement of compliance. Waiver of these requirements may occur only after careful, thorough, and documented analysis. Without these commitments, responsibilities, and tools, the risk is great that new systems will not meet business needs, will be incompatible, will perform poorly, and will cost more to develop, integrate, and maintain than is warranted.

<h1 id="1.0">1.0 Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="1.1">1.1 Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to the City of Austin in initiating, developing, using, and maintaining an enterprise architecture. This guide offers an end-to-end process to initiate, implement, and sustain an EA program, and describes the necessary roles and responsibilities for a successful EA program. An EA establishes the citywide roadmap to achieve a department's mission through optimal performance of its core business processes within an efficient IT environment. Simply stated, enterprise architectures are &quot;blueprints&quot; for systematically defining an organization's current (baseline) or desired (target) environment. Enterprise architectures are essential for evolving information systems, developing new systems, and inserting emerging technologies that optimize their mission value.

<h2 id="1.2">1.2 Scope</h2>

<p>This guide focuses on EA processes, roles and responsibilities. This guide addresses the enterprise life cycle and it describes in detail how the EA processes relate to enterprise engineering, program management, and capital planning and investment control (CPIC) processes.

<h2 id="1.3">1.3 Audience</h2>

<p>This guide is intended primarily for COA leaders that currently do not have EAs and those that can benefit from improvements in their EA methods for development and maintenance. For departments without an EA, this document provides useful guidance to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and IT leadership for educating and obtaining key stakeholder commitment in establishing an effective EA program.

<p align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">Key Definitions
<p><b>Architecture</b> - The structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.
<p><b>Enterprise</b> -  An organization (or cross-organizational entity) supporting a defined business scope and mission. An enterprise includes interdependent resources (people, organizations, and technology) who must coordinate their functions and share information in support of a common mission (or set of related missions).
<p><b>Enterprise Architecture</b> - A strategic information asset base, which defines the mission, the process and information necessary to perform the mission, the technologies necessary to perform the mission, and the transitional processes for implementing new technologies in response to changing mission needs. An enterprise architecture includes a baseline architecture, target architecture, and a Sequencing Plan.
<p><b>Baseline architecture</b> - The set of products that portray the existing enterprise, the current business practices, and technical infrastructure. Commonly referred to as the &quot;As-Is&quot; architecture.
<p><b>Target architecture</b> - The set of products that portray the future or end-state enterprise, generally captured in the organization's strategic thinking and plans. Commonly referred to as the &quot;To-Be&quot; architecture.
<p><b>Sequencing Plan</b> - A document that defines the strategy for changing the enterprise from the current baseline to the target architecture. It schedules multiple, concurrent, interdependent activities, and incremental builds that will evolve the enterprise.
<p><b>Enterprise Architecture Products</b> - The graphics, models, and/or narrative that depicts the enterprise environment and design.

<p>EA terminology carries many variations within each organization and in the vast array of literature. Therefore, the authors have settled on one consistent set of definitions for key terms used within this guide. The definition for Enterprise Architecture is the endorsed definition from the Federal CIO Council and appears in the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF). Although the term enterprise is defined in terms of an organization, it must be understood that in many cases, the enterprise may transcend established organizational boundaries (e.g., trade, grant management, financial management, logistics, etc.). <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/" target="new_window">Appendix A</a> contains a listing of additional terms, their definitions, and the source authority.

<h2 id="2.2">2.2 The Uses and Benefits of Enterprise Architecture</h2>

<p>In general, the essential reasons for developing an EA include:
<ul>
<li><b>Alignment</b> - ensuring the reality of the implemented enterprise is aligned with management's intent
<li><b>Integration</b> - realizing that the business rules are consistent across the organization, that the data and its use are immutable, interfaces and information flow are standardized, and the connectivity and interoperability are managed across the enterprise
<li><b>Change</b> - facilitating and managing change to any aspect of the enterprise
<li><b>Time-to-market</b> - reducing systems development, applications generation, modernization timeframes, and resource requirements
<li><b>Convergence</b> - striving toward a standard IT product portfolio
</ul>

<p>An EA offers tangible benefits to the enterprise and those responsible for evolving the enterprise. The EA  provides the following:
<ul>
<li>Capture facts about the mission, functions, and business foundation in an understandable manner to promote better planning and decision making
<li>Improve communication among the business organizations and IT organizations within the enterprise through a standardized vocabulary
<li>Provide architectural views that help communicate the complexity of large systems and facilitate management of extensive, complex environments
<li>Focus on the strategic use of emerging technologies to better manage the enterprise's information and consistently insert those technologies into the enterprise
<li>Improve consistency, accuracy, timeliness, integrity, quality, availability, access, and sharing of IT-managed information across the enterprise
<li>Support the capital improvement project processes by providing a tool for assessment of benefits, impacts, and capital investment measurements and supporting analyses of alternatives, risks, and tradeoffs
<li>Highlight opportunities for building greater quality and flexibility into applications without increasing cost
<li>Achieve economies of scale by providing mechanisms for sharing services across the enterprise
<li>Expedite integration of legacy, migration, and new systems
<li>Ensure legal and regulatory compliance. The primary purpose of an EA is to inform, guide, and constrain the decisions for the enterprise, especially those related to IT investments. The true challenge of enterprise engineering is to maintain the architecture as a primary authoritative resource for enterprise IT planning. This goal is not met via enforced policy, but by the value and utility of the information provided by the EA
</ul>

<h2 id="2.3">2.3 Architecture Principles</h2>

<p>Principles establish the basis for a set of rules and behaviors for an organization. There are principles that govern the EA process and principles that govern the implementation of the architecture. Architectural principles for the EA process affect development, maintenance, and use of the EA. Architectural principles for EA implementation establish the first tenets and related decision-making guidance for designing and developing information systems. The Chief Enterprise Architect, in conjunction with the CIO and select Department business managers, defines the architectural principles that map to the organization's IT vision and strategic plans. As shown in Figure 1, architectural principles should represent fundamental requirements and practices believed to be good for the organization. These principles should be refined to meet department's business needs. It should be possible to map specific actions, such as EA development, systems acquisitions, and implementation, to the architectural principles. Deliberate and explicit standards-oriented policies and guidelines for the EA development and implementation are generated in compliance with the principles. Each phase of the systems life cycle is supported by the actions necessitated by the architecture principles. CPIC actions are governed by the implications within the principles.

<p><a href="archPrinciples.htm" target="new_window">Appendix B</a> provides sample EA principles for consideration as a starting point, as well as the rationale for and the impact of implementing each principle. Each department should apply, add to, or modify these sample principles. Formulating these supporting statements should be an essential part of the City's effort to define its principles.

<h2 id="2.4">2.4 The Enterprise Life Cycle</h2>

<p>The enterprise life cycle is the dynamic, iterative process of changing the enterprise over time by incorporating new business processes, new technology, and new capabilities, as well as maintenance and disposition of existing elements of the enterprise.

<p>Although the EA process is the primary topic of this guide, it cannot be discussed without consideration of other closely related processes. These include the enterprise engineering and program management cycle (more commonly known as the system development/acquisition life cycle) that aids in the implementation of an EA, and the CPIC process that selects, controls, and evaluates investments. Overlying these processes are human capital management and information security management. When these processes work together effectively, the enterprise can effectively manage IT as a strategic resource and business process enabler. When these processes are properly synchronized, systems migrate efficiently from legacy technology environments through evolutionary and incremental developments, and the City is able to demonstrate its return on investment. Figure 2 illustrates the interaction of the dynamic and interactive cycles as they would occur over time.

<h2 id="2.5">2.5 The Enterprise Architecture Process</h2>

<p>As a prerequisite to the development of every enterprise architecture, each department should establish the need to develop an EA and formulate a strategy that includes the definition of a vision, mission, capabilities, and measurable goals. The EA Program Management Office assists departments in defining these elements in the Corporate EA. Figure 3 shows a representation of the EA process. Executive buy-in and support should be established and an architectural team created within the organization. The team defines an approach and process tailored to department needs. The architecture team implements the process to build both the baseline and target EAs. The architecture team also generates a Sequencing Plan for the transition of systems, applications, and associated business practices predicated upon a detailed gap analysis. The architecture is employed in the CPIC, enterprise engineering and program management processes via prioritized, incremental projects and the insertion of emerging new technologies. Lastly, the architectures are maintained through a continuous modification to reflect the department's current baseline and target business practices, organizational goals, visions, technology, and infrastructure.

<h1 id="3.0">3.0 Initiate Enterprise Architecture Program</h1>

<p>The enterprise architecture is a COA Corporate asset that should be managed as a formal Citywide program. The EA should not be viewed as an IT asset; rather, the EA should be viewed as a business stakeholder asset that delivers business needs (requirements) to the IT solution provider. Successful execution of the EA process is a citywide endeavor requiring management, allocation of resources, continuity, and coordination. City business line executives should work closely with the Corporate architecture team to produce a description of the agency's operations, a vision of the future, and an investment and technology strategy for accomplishing defined goals.

<p>Experience shows that obtaining the needed cooperation among City executives is not an easy task - creating an EA program calls for sustained leadership and a strong commitment. This degree of sponsorship and commitment needs the buy-in of the City Manager, leadership by the CIO, and a formally designated authority of a Chief Enterprise Architect.

<h2 id="3.1">3.1 Obtain Executive Buy-in and Support</h2>

<p>Gaining executive commitment to any new initiative requires the development of a strong business case and a communications approach to effectively convey that business case. Since the concept of an EA is not intuitively understood, the CIO and the Chief Enterprise Architect creates a marketing strategy to communicate the strategic and tactical value for EA development to the City Manager, other senior City executives, and business units.

<h3 id="3.1.1">3.1.1 Ensure City Manager Buy-in and Support</h3>

<p>Without buy-in from the City Manager, the CIO will find it hard to maintain the necessary sponsorship desired to fund and implement improved systems and processes. The CIO takes the lead to provide understanding and gain the City Manager's buy-in. This can be accomplished by:
<ul>
<li>Leveraging success stories from other City and private sector organizations as well as the experience and knowledge of EA experts
<li>Use examples to demonstrate how an EA provides a blueprint and roadmap for desired changes or improvements in mission performance and accountability
</ul>

<p>Once the CIO is assured the City Manager understands the need for an EA, it is important to secure the City Manager's commitment to pursue the architecture effort. The CIO accomplishes this by mobilizing the City Manager's appreciation into the expression of clear, citywide support. This  establishes a mandate to business and IT executives to support the EA effort by allocating the needed time and resources. The CIO should coordinate with the City Manager on the selection of City executives to be designated as department architecture leads responsible to the Chief Enterprise Architect. Experience demonstrates that the CIO's authority alone is insufficient to make the endeavor a success. A clear mandate from the City Manager is a prerequisite to success.

<h3 id="3.1.2">3.1.2 Issue an Executive Enterprise Architecture Policy</h3>

<p>The CIO, in collaboration with the City Manager, develops a policy based on the City's architecture principles that governs the development, implementation, and maintenance of the EA. The EA policy should be approved by the City Manager and, at a minimum, should include the following:
<ul>
<li>Description of the purpose and value of an EA
<li>Description of the relationship of the EA to the City's strategic vision and plans
<li>Description of the relationship of the EA to capital planning, enterprise engineering, and program management
<li>Translation of business strategies into EA strategies, goals, and objectives
<li>Commitment to develop, implement, and maintain an EA
<li>Identification of EA compliance as one criterion for new and ongoing investments
<li>Overview of an enforcement policy
<li>Identification of authority of the Chief Enterprise Architect
<li>Establishment of the EA Program Management Office
</ul>

<h3 id="3.1.3">3.1.3 Obtain Support from Senior Executives and Business Units</h3>

<p>Commitment and participation of the City's senior executive and business teams are vitally important. The CIO initiates a marketing program to emphasize the value of the architecture and the City Manager's support and commitment. The senior executive team and its organizational units are both stakeholders and users of the architecture. Therefore, the CIO invests time and effort in familiarizing the staff with what an EA is and how it can help achieve organizational goals and commitments. The CIO may seek assistance from the Chief Enterprise Architect for this activity. Even though the target audience varies among departments, the audience includes the assistants, deputies and their key staffs.

<p>The primary goal of educating the department senior executives is to obtain their concurrence and commitment to having their organizations as active participants. Participation can involve the executives (or their designees) in attending planning sessions, committing resources (people and funding) for specific tasks, or becoming a champion or spokesperson for the effort. Maintaining the participation and support of key executives is crucial to sustaining a successful effort.

<p>With CIO assistance, the Chief Enterprise Architect creates a plan to obtain the support of the enterprise's business units. It is recommended that the business units establish an &quot;inner circle&quot; of domain owners and subject matter experts (SMEs). This leadership group consists of business unit managers who &quot;own&quot; specific lines of business. This leadership group should be able to understand and communicate enterprise goals and objectives, and to think creatively, with consideration of budgets and other constraints. This group of managers is responsible for ensuring that the business layers of the architecture are properly documented, and that the Sequencing Plan makes sense from the perspective of the business strategy, considering both automated and non-automated processes.

<p>Once the EA policy has been disseminated, the CIO and Chief Enterprise Architect organizes and conducts a program kickoff meeting to explain the EA goals, objectives, processes, products, and interrelationships with activities of the systems development life cycle, capital planning and investment process, and other related activities. The goal of the program kickoff meeting is to promote buy-in by program participants at middle and lower levels of the organization. After several of the first EA products are developed and analyzed, the products and analysis are disseminated throughout the City and its communities of interest to demonstrate the value of these early results and achieve maximum exposure for the benefits of the EA development effort.

<h2 id="3.2">3.2 Establish Management Structure and Control</h2>

<p>Figure 4 illustrates a proposed program organization to manage, control, and monitor EA activity and progress. The organization shows the desired functional roles, interrelationships, and lines of communication. The organization structure should facilitate and advance the performance of EA roles and responsibilities. The roles of the Enterprise Architecture Executive Steering Committee (EAESC), Technical Review Committee (TRC), and the EA Program Management Office (EAPMO) are unique to the introduction of the EA process. Other roles, such as Quality Assurance (QA), Configuration Management (CM), Risk Management (RM), Security, and Evaluation are customary IT support roles. These roles are expanded to explicitly include EA-related responsibilities.

<p>EA roles should be evaluated based on the size of the department, the complexity of the business and architecture, and other factors to effectively determine the correlation of roles assigned to personnel. In a large department with complex business processes, an individual may be responsible for one specific role. In smaller department, an individual may be assigned several roles and responsibilities.

<p><img src="organization.png" border=0 width="675"><br>
Figure 4. Proposed EA Organization
</td></tr></table>

<h3 id="3.2.1">3.2.1 Enterprise Architecture Executive Steering Committee</h3>

<p>The Department Directors Advisory Council (DDAC) directs, oversees, and approves the EA and EA projects - they act in the capacity of an EA Executive Steering Committee (EAESC). The EAESC is responsible for approving the EA, approving significant changes to the EA, and approving the EA Program Plan. The EAESC with a designated chair or co-chairs is empowered to ensure citywide strategic direction, oversight, and decision-making authority for the EA. The DDAC charter should authorize the chair or co-chairs to appoint the membership. By charter, the EAESC membership should consist of active participants that represent major City business and technology areas. To perform effectively as a decision-making body, it is crucial that the EAESC members are senior leaders, with the authority to commit resources and make and enforce decisions within their respective organizations.

<h3 id="3.2.2">3.2.2 Capital Investment Council</h3>

<p>The IT Steering Committee (ITSC) acts in the capacity of the Capital Investment Council (CIC) to achieve informed decision making regarding costs, benefits, risks of alternative investment options and EA alignment. The goal of the CIC is to ensure enterprise and application architecture projects are feasible from a cost-benefit standpoint. The CIC reviews proposed IT investments and makes the final investment funding decision. It accepts program and project proposals that have been assessed by the EA Executive Steering Committee (i.e., DDAC) and determines whether these programs/projects fit within the overall budgetary and funding goals for the enterprise. While a project may be technically aligned with the EA, the CIC may reject funding for a project because of other external constraints or budgetary reasons. CIC decisions may necessitate updates to the EA Sequencing Plan.

<h3 id="3.2.3">3.2.3 Technical Review Committee</h3>

<p>The CIO Council (CIOC) acts in the capacity of the Technical Review Committee (TRC) and manages the review of candidate projects and assess project alignment with the EA. The TRC ensures that the CIO Technology Team vets new technologies through the EA. TRC members may delegate responsibility to a designated department architect with the understanding that the designated representative keeps the TRC member informed on important architecture decisions. Once the EA has been developed and approved, the TRC assesses each proposed investment for compliance with the architecture. The TRC reports their conclusions and provides recommendations to the EAESC and CIC.

<p>In all cases, the TRC determines and documents the results and the accompanying rationale for its actions. The TRC reviews a project and assesses if:
<ul>
<li>The project completely aligns with the EA
<li>The project does not align with the EA and an alternate course of action is needed
<li>The project does not align with the EA and a waiver is approved
</ul>
<p>The TRC approves a waiver only if the impacts of the lack of EA alignment are understood and acceptable. By approving a waiver, the TRC conveys to the EAESC and CIC that it does not object to the proposed project.

<h3 id="3.2.4">3.2.4 Chief Enterprise Architect</h3>

<p>A City executive serves as Chief Enterprise Architect and EA Program Manager. The Chief Enterprise Architect is responsible for leading the development of the EA work products and support environment. The Chief Enterprise Architect serves as the technology and business leader for the development organization, ensuring the integrity of the architectural development processes and the content of the EA products. The Chief Enterprise Architect should be friend and liaison to the business units and ensure that business unit processes are emphasized in the EA. Likewise, the Chief Enterprise Architect is responsible for ensuring that the EA provides the best possible information and guidance to IT projects and stakeholders, and that systems development efforts are properly aligned with business unit requirements.

<p>In the role of EA Program Manager, the Chief Enterprise Architect has management responsibility for the EA program, with the authority, responsibility, and accountability for the overall architectural effort. The EA Program Manager is responsible for the planning, staffing, and ultimate success of the program, including acquisition of sustaining funding, negotiating schedules, timely and accurate delivery of the EA products, and the establishment of an appropriate support environment that ensures proper application of these assets.

<p>The core competencies of the Chief Enterprise Architect include expertise in strategic and technical planning, policy development, capital planning and investment control, change management, systems engineering and architectural design, business process reengineering, and large-scale program management. In addition, the Chief Enterprise Architect becomes completely conversant with the department's business and IT environments. As the primary technical leader of this effort, the Chief Enterprise Architect should be a good communicator who can bridge the cultural differences that often exist between the business and systems organizations, and facilitate interaction and cooperation between these two cultures.

<h3 id="3.2.5">3.2.5 Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office</h3>

<p>The EA effort should be treated as a formal Citywide program with full sponsorship through the City's capital planning and investment control process. An EA Program Management Office (EAPMO) manages, monitors, and controls the development and maintenance of the EA. The EAPMO staff includes experienced architects and supported by business line domain owners and the Communications and Technology Management Program Management Office (CTM PMO) when appropriate. The EAPMO identifies and performs cost analysis of alternative approaches for developing the EA, and manages in-house or outside contractor EA development work. The EAPMO is also charged with determining needed resources and securing funding and resource commitments.

<p>A primary goal of the EAESC (i.e., DDAC) and the EAPMO is to ensure success of the EA program. Each phase of the program (i.e., EA development, use, and maintenance) is subject to the CIC (i.e., ITSC) policies and procedures for investment decisions.

<h4 id="3.2.5.1">3.2.5.1 Appoint Key Personnel</h4>

<p>The CIO should make the EA an explicit responsibility for those individuals designated as the organization's Evaluators, Risk Manager, and Configuration Manager. The Risk Manager identifies, monitors, controls, and mitigates EA program risks in light of environmental factors (e.g., external business constraints and technical constraints). The Configuration Manager assumes responsibility for configuration management of the EA products in the same way that configuration management is imposed on any other engineering baseline. The CIO should establish an independent Quality Assurance (QA) organization to perform evaluation of the EA. This team should report to the EAESC and ensure all established program and project standards and processes are met. Potential sources for review include external reference groups, impartial or uninvolved external entities, or by hiring a neutral third party specializing in assessments or validations.

<h4 id="3.2.5.2">3.2.5.2 Establish Enterprise Architecture Core Team</h4>

<p>A core team of IT experts, business line experts, and technologists should be assigned to develop the desired business process and procedures used throughout the development effort. Participants should have an understanding of the current business and technical environment and the strategic business objectives envisioned in the EA. The core team is lead by the Chief Enterprise Architect and includes senior business, data, infrastructure, security and systems architects as needed. This team should be well grounded in the existing environment and prepared to document and develop the EA that will support evolving business needs. As the project gets underway, more resources/team members are typically added to the architecture core team. The architecture core team may include project managers proficient in managing citywide programs to assist the Chief Enterprise Architect.

<p>A project manager from the Program Management Office (PMO) may be appointed to assist the EAPMO for projects where the EA provides requirements in the form of functional needs assessment based on an architectural engineering analysis. The project manager, however, defers to the EAPMO for enterprise architecture specific principles, processes, and guidance. The project manager is primarily responsible for overall cost, schedule and performance considerations of the project where EA is a contributing element to the project objectives. For projects with a high degree of architectural significance, the project manager ensures compliance with the EAPMO managed and controlled Sequencing Plan. The project manager ensures EA artifacts are leveraged based on the purpose statement prescribed in the <a href="archPrinciples.htm" target="new_window">Architecture Principles</a> for each architecture project.

<p>Under the authority of the Chief Enterprise Architect, the EA core team is responsible for all activities involving the development, implementation, maintenance, and management of the architecture. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Developing EA processes, procedures, and standards
<li>Developing baseline and target architectures
<li>Developing and maintaining an EA repository
<li>Performing quality assurance, risk management, and configuration management
<li>Guiding systems development and acquisition efforts
<li>Defining EA performance measures
</ul>

<h3 id="3.3.1">3.3.1 Develop an EA Marketing Strategy and Communications Plan</h3>

<p>The purpose of the marketing strategy and communications plan is (1) to keep senior executives and business units continually informed, and (2) to disseminate EA information to management teams. The CIO's staff, in cooperation with the Chief Enterprise Architect and support staff, defines a marketing and communications plan consisting of (a) constituencies, (b) level of detail, (c) means of communication, (d) participant feedback, (e) schedule for marketing efforts, and (f) method of evaluating progress and buy-in. It is the CIO's role to interpret the City Manager's vision and to recognize innovative ideas (e.g., the creation of a digital government) that can become key drivers within the EA strategy and plan. If resources permit, the Chief Enterprise Architect should use one or all of the following tools to communicate with the community of interest: seminars and forums, web pages, electronic surveys, and email.

<p>One of the recommended means for marketing the EA is a primer to inform City business executives and stakeholders of the EA strategy and plan. The primer can be used to express the City Manager's vision for the enterprise and the role of EA in accomplishing that vision - for example, creating the integrated foundation for online government or streamlining business processes and technology.

<p>The primer should describe the tenets of the EA and its many benefits as an agent of change in achieving organizational goals (e.g., integrating business services and initiatives) or as a critical resource to evaluate options for change as business and technology needs evolve. The primer should clearly describe the roles and responsibilities of the senior executives and their organizational units in developing, implementing, and maintaining the EA. It is important that the primer include customized sections that relate directly to specific business line audiences.

<p>The primer should demonstrate the benefits of an EA for the agency's stakeholders. This is particularly important since many of the stakeholders may be needed to provide skilled resources, support, and time to the effort. Once completed, the primer should be widely distributed throughout the City and made available on the City's Web site. It should be briefed to all personnel impacted by the introduction of the EA. Introductory materials drawn from the primer should be incorporated into local and citywide training programs.

<h3 id="3.3.2">3.3.2 Develop an EA Program Management Plan</h3>

<p>A formal plan is desired for sound program management. The EAPMO creates an EA program management plan (PMP) that includes a roadmap to accomplish the goals set by the EAESC (i.e., DDAC) and implementation plans to achieve those goals. The plan should include goals for the Chief Enterprise Architect in setting citywide architectural objectives. These goals should help the architecture team establish and maintain lower-level architectures that comply with the EA. The PMP delineates plans and a set of actions to develop, use, and maintain the EA, including EA management, control, and oversight. To facilitate the tracking of cost, schedule, and performance data, oversight and control procedures should be developed, documented, and implemented within the PMP. The PMP should also include:
<ul>
<li>Requirements for the EA Program Manager to identify all funding requirements, spending timelines/schedules, and links to performance measures
<li>A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) detailing the tasks and subtasks necessary to acquire, develop, and maintain the architecture
<li>Resource estimates for funding, staffing, training, workspace requirements, and equipment needs
<li>Roadmap for the initiation of project plans
<li>Requirements for performing quality assurance, risk management, configuration management, and security management
<li>Requirements for the establishment and maintenance of an EA information repository
</ul>

<h3 id="3.3.3">3.3.3 EA Training Plan</h3>

<p>The Chief Enterprise Architect is responsible for developing an EA training program to train future architects on the principles and processes used to develop the Citywide enterprise architecture. See <a href="http://austinea.org/training/trainingplan/executivesummary.html" target="new_window">Appendix D</a> for more information.

<h3 id="3.3.4">3.3.4 Initiate Development of the Enterprise Architecture</h3>

<p>Once the EAPMO is in place and the PMP is produced, the first of the architecture projects is launched. There are several peripheral activities associated with the start of this development.

<p>The EAPMO's initial project will:
<ul>
<li>Institute PMP practices
<li>Establish EA development processes and management practices
<li>Train EA project participants
<li>Build baseline EA products
<li>Build target EA products (as possible)
<li>Populate the EA repository
<li>Create the Sequencing Plan
</ul>

<h1 id="4.0">4.0 Summary</h1>

<p>This guide to EA development, maintenance, and use offers a practical &quot;how-to&quot; manual that assists the City in initiating, developing, and maintaining an EA program in conjunction with other management processes. The EA is, by definition, a model of the City's enterprise and its future direction. Its value to the business operations should be more than simply IT investment decision management. The dynamic changes in technology and business practices impose greater pressure on the City to respond more rapidly to these stimuli than ever before. The EA is the main tool to reduce the response time for impact assessment, tradeoff analysis, strategic plan redirection, and tactical reaction.

<p>Along with their importance in the capital planning and investment management arena, EAs provide a snapshot in time of the City's business and technology assets. They are the blueprint to build upon the roadmap to systems and business migration. They help mitigate risk factors in enterprise modernization, identify opportunities for innovative technology insertion, and aid executives and managers in key decision making at all levels of the organization. And these are but a few of the benefits of maintaining a thorough EA. The EA process is a long-term, continuous effort. Once developed, the EA is a &quot;living&quot; entity with many parts, whether in the form of a document, database or repository, or Web page. To remain current and of optimal value, this &quot;living architecture&quot; needs continual care and maintenance. This, in turn, demands an organizational commitment from top to bottom, since department resources in time, money, and people should be dedicated to the architecture's maintenance for the long term.

<p>As a department begins its EA efforts, its architecture proponents should secure corporate commitment and buy-in from senior executives and all levels of the organization. Without engaging the entire City from the top down, the architecture effort will face an uphill struggle during much of its existence. Thus, the initial stages of the architecture effort will need extensive work obtaining commitment and backing, grounding the EA in an approved framework, and establishing a functioning architecture structure within the City organization.

<p>As one of the first steps, the City's Chief Enterprise Architect has established a well-proven architecture framework based on practical Department of Defense (DoD) experience. This framework will be demonstrated in future city leadership presentations.
