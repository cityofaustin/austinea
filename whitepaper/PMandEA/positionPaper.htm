<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Understanding Roles between EA and PMO

<p>The following position paper explains the boundary issues regarding the project management office and enterprise architecture. A more comprehensive white paper is at <a href="http://austinea.org/whitepaper/PMandEA/">Understanding Roles between EA and PMO</a>.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Where's the boundary between project management responsibilities and enterprise architecture?

<ul>
<li>Project managers and their staff frequently develop business user needs to include technical and functional requirements
<li>Enterprise architects employs a method yielding technical standards and business functional needs
</ul>

<p>[Note: Clearly, there's a competing role…]

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Enterprise Architecture is Innovative
<ul>
<li>Innovation is not invention
<li>Innovation is doing something different
<li>Innovation is frequently disruptive!
</ul>

<p>[Note: Not everyone benefits from the change innovation creates.]

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Differentiation between PM and EA
<ul>
<li>Project Management initiates, plans, executes, controls, and closes the work of a team to achieve specific goals to meet specific success criteria (objectives)
<li>Enterprise Architecture is a process of translating business vision and strategy into business goals and objectives
</ul>

<p>[Note: EA works with business to create goals and objectives and the PMO executes goals and objectives - this creates the perception that the PMO is working for EA... However, in reality, EA and the PMO both work for business. I suspect this is our problem…]

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Roles
<ul>
<li>EA is responsible to assist business leaders in vision, mission, capability, goal and objective identification leading to a comprehensive use case model describing visionary use of IT business systems
<li>Architecture includes the people, process and technology to accomplish the business mission while achieving the business target vision through select business goals (not just IT goals!)
<li>EA derives sequencing plans from capability area architectures
<ul>
<li>Establishes the relationships (i.e., dependencies) between business capabilities (i.e., services) and business goals
<li>Process includes the identity of important goal dependencies and their influence on important business outcomes to accomplish the mission
</ul>
<li>EA doesn't tell business people or the PMO what to do
<ul>
<li>EA facilitates the discussion and provides a process between the PMO and business leadership to create a sequencing plan to ensure achievement of the business vision
</ul>
<li>EA reports to business leaders to create business architectures to guide IT project management to successful business solutions
<ul>
<li>On approval, the business stakeholder authorizes delivery of the business architecture to IT project management
</ul>
<li>IT project management uses the business architecture to plan implementation (proposal development, contracting, coordinate resource needs, planning, outsourcing strategies, etc.)
<ul>
<li>Identified changes to the business architecture is coordinated with enterprise architecture
</ul>
</ul>

<p>[Note: Approach is fully compliant with the EA Roadmap…]
