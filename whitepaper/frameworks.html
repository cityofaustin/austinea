<p><b>Viewpoint on Frameworks</b></p>
<p>Frameworks largely provide an abstraction of the (class) categories an architect should achieve and a stack of abstraction layers to identify important relationships between them. Frameworks guide the architect through an understanding of what architectural elements/views are needed; however, they fall short of explaining how to achieve the categorical desired transformation. I believe frameworks do this on purpose because there is no agreed standard to achieve the desired results. Over the years, myself, my mentors and peers have pursued architectural methods to successfully implement enterprise roadmaps and occasionally look back to frameworks with curiosity to examine the architectural stacks and their validity. For the most part, these frameworks succeed in identifying the important class structures yielding the important value to the enterprise.</p>

<p>I can explain an approach to turn vision and mission into real transformational change beginning with an operational concept all the way to correctable gaps; however, this story, to be completely comprehensible, requires a book. A book that someday I hope to write. So, the best I can do here is provide a glimpse of my book's executive summary...</p>

<p>I believe object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) will be the architectural approach used by most, if not all, architects in the coming decades. Old school, structured analysis architects will argue against this viewpoint; however, someday they will retire and a new generation of younger OOAD architects will wonder why you would do it any other way. OOAD requires a different way of thinking about architecture with objects (instances of classes - roles, information, systems, etc.) foremost and OOAD accurately captures the nature of our highly interface focused world. Whereas, structured thinking architects examine the problem from a functional viewpoint - frequently referred to as functional analysis. Today, many (if not most) EA tools on the market are founded on functional analysis principles; however, OOAD is slowly emerging through tools that employ the Unified Modeling Language (UML). I recognize this is a controversial assertion - only to be proved long after I'm gone.</p>

<p>The good thing about the UML is it's a very colorful language with abstraction, stereotypes and relationships to describe very complex architectures. In fact, there has never been a process of any complexity that I couldn't render accurately in UML. The bad thing about the UML is it's a very colorful language with abstraction, stereotypes and relationships to describe very complex architectures; therefore, it's much harder to learn and more difficult to be successful. The problem is further compounded because functional thinkers sometimes have difficulty making the object-oriented transition. I have witnessed this many times as I've observed my older students functionally decompose their UML use case models. A few conceded that they were unable to make this mental transformation and dropped out. You're probably wondering what this has to do with your framework question...</p>

<p>It's simply this - albeit not so simple... A skilled OOAD architect can analyze the enterprise to identify common (or shared) capabilities and goals. When I say capability, I mean the people, processes and technology that deliver value to the enterprise - one might also refer to this as a service. Because process exercises capabilities, common capabilities yields common process, which &quot;should&quot; result in common infrastructure and data. I say should because your enterprise may not yield this result, which could be an identified gap. Therefore, by recognizing common capabilities and shared goals, the architect can identify important value-based use case models. These models are the point where the architect explores business solutions with relevant stakeholders using the UML method, which yields good customer relationship management - i.e., understanding the business need.</p>

<p>OOAD provides a way to treat the subject system as a &quot;black box.&quot; This is a form of information hiding (OO principle) that allows the architect to describe the desired scope in the form of roles, responsibilities, business rules, process, and information interfaces with other systems (as roles in the environment) necessary to achieve the desired &quot;result of value&quot; to accomplish the vision, mission and goals of the enterprise. Because the &quot;black box&quot; model does not prescribe a solution, rather a behavior at the system surface, the solution space is open for a &quot;white box&quot; executable design. In fact, the design is only constrained by the business need at the edges of the black box, which ensures a successful business solution.</p>

<p>As an architecture community, we need to come to terms on a standard... Until we agree on a standard, our frameworks will continue to be abstract, high-level, theoretical concepts with little relationship to real world implementations. If we can overcome what a colleague of mine calls the function trap, architecture can do some amazing enterprise transformations.</p>
