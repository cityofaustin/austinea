<p style="font-weight: bold;" align=center>Making the Impossible Possible through Enterprise Architecture
<p style="font-size: 8pt;" align=center>By Rob Byrd, Chief Enterprise Architect, City of Austin<br><br>

<p>Dream the big dream, that's what I always say. Without visualizing the impossible, we cannot understand what we might accomplish. This paper is all about realizing the necessary moment that we need as a city to achieve momentous accomplishments leading to a best-managed city. So how does a city gain momentum? Prior to this discussion, please view the <a href="http://youtu.be/4a4ZxOAQifE" target="new_window">YouTube video</a> by following the link. As you'll learn from the video, momentum equals mass times velocity and I'm here to make the argument that Enterprise Architecture can be the city's innovative technology to achieve the necessary momentum to accomplish the big dream.

<i>Enterprise blueprints, not unlike construction blueprints, provide mutual understanding and direction to improve city capabilities leading to best-managed city</i>
</td></tr></table>

<p>So let's look at the equation for momentum (<span class="redbold">momentum = mass x velocity</span>). In my view, mass equates to critical mass of understanding where all people involved clearly understand and therefore reduces ambiguity. On the surface, this may appear easy, but it's not. What makes us wonderful creatures is our diverse experience and what makes us difficult creatures is our diverse experience. A good example is to whisper an idea around a table and it doesn't take long for the story to take on a completely new meaning. What's needed is a city blueprint to provide unambiguous direction. We would not expect to build any structure of any complexity without blueprints. Otherwise, how would framers know what to frame, plumbers know what to plumb and electricians know what to wire? Yet we regularly take on the complexity of running our city without blueprints.

<p>I'm not talking about blueprints from the traditional building point of view - I'm talking about enterprise blueprints. There is a way to blueprint city capabilities and goals to aid in an understandable viewpoint on the important outcomes we're trying to accomplish. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is this blueprint and it can become the underlying instrument to provide momentum leading to well understood citywide outcomes.

<p>So what's the problem? The problem is that people don't know what EA is. They don't realize that there is a way to blueprint capabilities, goals, process, and roles to accomplish extremely complex undertakings. What people don't realize is that even a simple process can very quickly become quite complex. There are so many dependencies relevant to completing a goal to include business rules, operational process, organizational considerations, information technology, cost, schedule, and performance among others that make what appear on the surface to be simple to actually be quite complex. What EA provides is context - a mutually agreeable way to blueprint the solution first, gain everyone's concurrence on the solution, and a means to provide understandable blueprints for solution providers to deliver. Imagine that…

<p>Before we explore how to blueprint the enterprise, we need to explore some important terms such as:
<ul>
<li><span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">Vision:</span> Outlines what the organization wants to be, or how it wants the world in which it operates to be (an "idealized" view of the world). It is a long-term view and concentrates on a description of the future state. It can be emotive and is a source of inspiration.
<li><span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">Mission:</span> Defines the fundamental purpose of an organization or an enterprise, succinctly describing why it exists and what it does to achieve its vision. A high-level action or process description of an organization, spells out its overall goal, provides a path, and guides decision-making. A formal short written statement of an organization's value proposition.
<li><span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">Capability:</span> People, processes and systems delivering value for a specific purpose. The quality of being capable; to have the capacity or ability to do something, achieve specific effects or declared goals and objectives
<li><span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">Goal:</span> A desired result a person or a system envisions, plans and commits to achieve. A desired end-point in some sort of assumed development. Many people endeavor to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines (a milestone). Goals amplify and quantify the organization's Vision
<li><span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">Objective:</span> Quantifies a Goal - a performance measure of behavior
</ul>

<p>The dictionary defines these terms well, yet we frequently don't use them according to their definition. Sometimes we define vision as a mission, mission as vision, goal an objective, objective a goal, and etcetera. This leads to great confusion and misunderstanding of what we're trying to accomplish. In fact, this reduces project momentum because well-defined goals provide velocity in a given direction, which imply a lack of direction. I like to tell the story of a naval fleet going to war. Without the Admiral providing direction to the battle, individual ships might head off to different places - soon you no longer have a fighting fleet.

<p>If it is truly our vision to become the best-managed city in the world, we need to understand the important outcomes instrumental to running a city. Imagine the city as a "black-box." What are the goods and services that the citizens consider of value, i.e., important outcomes? These outcomes take the form of capabilities, i.e., people, processes, and systems delivering value for a specific purpose. For example, clean water, reliable energy, safe public, and a healthy community are just a few examples. With this knowledge, we can begin to understand the processes we use to deliver these important outcomes. However, we must recognize that there are literally thousands of processes necessary to exercise the various city capabilities. For example, Human Capital Management documented in excess of 75 processes to deliver on the outcome of a capable city staff delivering city services. Follow the link to <a href="/austinea/hrsa/" target="new_window2">Human Resources Department Use Case Index</a> for a good example. This index provides additional links to various HR processes and clearly demonstrates the scale and complexity of our problem - it's clear that we don't have the resources to document every process we do. However, we can identify important processes requiring improvement.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Review
<ul>
<li>Capability = value or outcome [people, process and systems delivering value]
<li>Goal = velocity in a particular direction
<li>Process = exercises capability

</td></tr></table>
<p>Using enterprise architecture techniques, we can identify common capabilities and establish common goals. There are a much smaller number of important capabilities here at the city compared to the number of processes exercising them. A citywide capability model is achievable and can deliver value in a number of ways. For example, with a citywide capability model we can identify <span class="maroon">common capabilities</span> and <span class="maroon">shared outcomes</span>. This is similarly true for goals. City leadership has goals and these goals typically improve on any given capability or create a future capability that does not yet exist. With this knowledge, we can identify shared goals where Enterprise Architecture can assist in defining the common processes to make business improvements and identify where technology solutions can optimize operational outcomes. Therefore, through the process of identifying shared capability and common goals, we can identify optimal opportunities where EA can assist in project momentum. In fact, let's get back to our discussion on the equation <span class=redbold>momentum = mass x velocity</span>.

<p>Goals equate to velocity in that goals provide velocity in a given direction. With this direction, we explore important shared processes, optimize operational outcomes through process improvements and identify where technology provides the optimal benefit. Inherently, we'll recognize common infrastructure and common data leading to a world-class business intelligence capability.

<p>Enterprise Architecture is a specialized skill and like any other skill, enterprise architects have the experience to view things from an outcome viewpoint. Reference the document in the figure provided by Austin Water Utility (AWU). Not characterized as capabilities or goals, the document contains many strategic items. From a skilled architect's viewpoint, the document discusses Employee Leadership and Development. Yet, the real meaning of the paragraph is the capability to Plan Succession. The architect uses the author's own words, rewrites the paragraph to emphasize the important outcome of a succession plan to add clarity to the outcome, and creates a Plan Succession modeled element.

</td></tr></table>
<p>Because the architect is familiar with other city capabilities, it's relatively easy for the architect to recognize opportunities for reuse such as Human Resources (HR) recognized need for Succession Management. It's not difficult, therefore, for the architect to draw the conclusion that planning succession is an important citywide need. Instead of each department pursuing their own succession planning, a better approach would be to develop a citywide HR succession management program for each department to capitalize on. Next, we'll explore a similar EA viewpoint for goals.

<p>Further inspection of the AWU strategic document reveals a goal to Innovate Operational Technology. Although titled as Innovation, its goal is to employ innovative operational technology to support timely improvements. On further inspection of the entire document, the architect provides a modeled view of the various strategic elements in the form of capabilities and goals.

<p>Because the capabilities and goals are now in a model, the architect can begin to identify dependencies between the capabilities and goals. This is impractical to perform in a word written document, but something intuitive when using a modeling tool. For example, the architect can draw some insightful conclusions such as the goal to Optimize Operations depends on Innovative Operational Technology. One can conclude that you can optimize operations only so much through process improvements - optimization is more likely to occur through innovative operational technology. Again, due to the architect's awareness of other department capability models such as the CIO Council initiative to provide Mobile Device Management, the architect can conclude that the CIO Council capability can share AWU's Innovative Operational Technology goal that depends on the Identify Key Mobile Apps and Information Needs goal set by the CIO Council. Because this goal depends on Define Mobility User Processes goal, this is an important milestone for AWU to employ Innovative Operational Technology.

<p>Working closely with AWU, the enterprise architect identified five important processes to include Schedule Automatically Generated Work Order, Correct SCADA Generated Alarm, Complete Work Order, Correct Identified Anomaly, and Process Asset Warranty as candidate processes to identify key mobile applications and information needs. Through careful inspection of the model, the architect can tell a compelling story why defining mobility user processes is necessary. We create the story by reading the model.
We need to define mobility user processes in order to identify key mobile applications and information needs to provide an innovative operational technology to optimize operations to better respond to customer needs while sustaining the environment. These are important goals of the Manage Assets capability; therefore, you are inherently improving on this important business outcome.
