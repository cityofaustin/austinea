<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">EA Strategic Planning Meta-Model</p>

<p>To help folks understand the Enterprise Architecture (EA) strategic planning process, I created the following strategic planning meta-model (see below). The model is based on Business Motivation Model (BMM) principles - an industry standard. You can select the image to view in your browser to follow the discussion.</p>

<p>The Mission accomplishes a Vision and Capability (sometimes referred to as service) relate to mission in that, capabilities represent the outcomes produced by the mission to accomplish the vision. Capability is a container representation of process 'types' described by activity models, sequence diagrams and logical data models. It is the successful execution of these processes that deliver the capability's value, effect or outcome. Activity models show the process that exercise the capability to produce the desired outcome important to the mission. Activity models show controlled flow (business rules) that represent behavior. Behavior is defined by a Sequence Diagram to describe the desired user experience defining people using the system and how systems dialog with other systems to accomplish the activity. You can find an example implementation of this meta-model by following the link to <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ehs/" target="new_window">Environmental Health Services</a>. Once defined, the team has a mutually understandable framework to discuss what it means to perform service management among other process improvement benefits. Capabilities have Goals and are measured by Objectives. Many years of experience have shown that goals relate best to capabilities because goals are meant to improve important outcomes, which in turn 'amplify' the vision. This model is the basis of Business Motivation Models (BMM), which was established as a standard by the OMG in 2005.</p>

<p>The meta-model also reveals that a mission can be accomplished by one to many capabilities and capabilities may have relationships such as one capability might be &laquo;Part Of&raquo; another or a capability may &laquo;Depend On&raquo; another. Dependency relationships also may occur between Goals - this is instrumental in establishing a viable strategic plan or roadmap.</p> 

<p>The main elements of BMM are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ends: What (as oppose to how) the business wants to accomplish (Vision and Goals)
<li>Means: How the business intends to accomplish its ends (Process)
<li>Directives: The rules and policies that constrain or govern the available means (Activity Models and Sequence Diagrams)
<li>Influencers: Can cause changes that affect the organization in its employment of its means or achievement of its ends. Influencers are neutral by definition. (Goal Dependencies)
<li>Assessment: A judgment of an Influencer that affects the organization's ability to achieve its ends or use its means. (Objectives)
</ul>

<p>Our EA practice uses <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/#updm" target="new_window">UPDM</a> also an <a href="http://omg.org">Object Management Group (OMG)</a> standard - UPDM employs BMM principles fully… In fact, the associative labels were automatically generated by our EA tool. The tool prevents the architect from making illegal associations because it employs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Constraint_Language">Object Constraint Language (OCL)</a>. By using the EA tool, we can determine cross dependencies between business domains to identify common capabilities and shared goals. Goals are analogous to milestones, and therefore, provide the building blocks for a roadmap and work plan. Objective measures determine the performance in accomplishing the goal.</p>
