<h1 style="text-align: center;">EA is More than Information Technology</h1>

<p>There's plenty of Internet mumbo-jumbo regarding what enterprise architecture (EA) is and isn't. Simply put, the purpose of EA is to improve operational and business efficiencies. Much of the confusion regarding the role of enterprise architects comes from the traditional recognition that EA is an information technology (IT) thing… For example, the City of Austin's official job title is IT Chief Enterprise Architect. This directly implies the City's Chief Architect is the Information Technology Architect. This line of thinking puts the City's enterprise architecture practice at risk. Enterprise architecture is NOT an Information Technology issue - it is a Management issue. See John Zachman's article <a href="https://www.zachman.com/resources/zblog/item/defining-enterprise-architecture-misunderstandings" target="_blank">Defining Enterprise Architecture: Misunderstandings</a>. Considered the principal of enterprise architecture, John created the first enterprise framework - still popular today. In 1987 he originated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachman_Framework" target="_blank">Zachman Framework</a> a standard for classifying the descriptive representations (models) that comprise enterprise architecture.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zachman">[1]</a>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting with IT Architecture</span>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The first question the IT Enterprise Architect will ask is, &quot;What are the business needs required of the IT solution or design?&quot; Starting with an IT architect is fitting of the proverb of the horse behind the cart. An IT architect is an information technology designer, and without a business or operational architecture to guide the solution, the IT architect is likely lost or misguided. I'd suggest that there's no such thing as an IT Enterprise Architect (sometimes referred as Enterprise IT Architect); rather, system or solution architect is a better title. The Operational/Business Architecture guides the solution architect. An Enterprise Architecture includes Operational/Business Architecture plus System/Solution Architecture plus Technical/Standards Architecture, which is all things enterprise. Therefore, the IT Enterprise Architect is actually an Enterprise System/Solution Architect. By the City's own definition, the purpose of the IT Chief Enterprise Architect is to develop, maintain and leverage the enterprise architecture including process definition and integration across the organization, identifying requirements for resources, structures and cultural changes - all captured by the business architecture. The city's purpose description more closely aligns to the definition of an Enterprise Architect not a IT Enterprise Architect, which equates to an IT designer. Each of the various architectures discussed below are similar to Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework#Enterprise_architecture_domains">The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)</a> for enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture. Starting in 1995 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group">The Open Group</a>, the DoD's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFIM">Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM)</a> is the basis of TOGAF. Both are influenced by Zachman.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Operational/Business Architecture

<p>Operational or business architecture products provide high-level views of the business needs in the form of capabilities (collection of people, process and technology delivering business value). These architectures communicate vision, mission, business outcomes and goals. They identify the dependency relationships useful in the decision process. These architecture views clarify the intended purpose of the architecture - i.e., the important business outcomes and milestones (goals) to achieve. Operational or business architecture products provide descriptions of the tasks and activities, operational elements, and information exchanges to accomplish the business mission - we call these Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case models. The operational or business view provides textual and graphical representations of operational roles and elements, assigned tasks and activities, and information flows between roles. It defines the type of information exchanged, the tasks and activities supported by these exchanges and the nature of the exchanges.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">System/Solution Architecture

<p>Systems or solution architecture provides a set of graphical and textual products that describe systems and interconnections providing for identified business functions of the Operational/Business Architecture. Systems or solution architecture products focus on specific physical systems with possibly specific physical (geographical) locations. The relationship between architecture data elements exemplify the System/Solution Architecture to the Operational/Business Architecture in order to procure and field solutions to organizations and their operations to accomplish the mission focused on the organizational vision.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Technical/Standards Architecture

<p>Technical or standards architecture products define technical standards, implementation conventions, and other criteria that govern the use by the Operational/Business and System/Solution Architecture.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Architecture_Framework#Systems_and_services_view">[2]</a>

<p>For example, the City of Austin's <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/hr/jobdesc/jobrptdesc.cfm?codeid=4701&CFID=31126373&CFTOKEN=f28b208ca0a2e81-8A159C85-C802-FC59-EAE49C492DA851EB">current defined purpose</a> more closely defines the role of an Enterprise Architect rather than an IT Enterprise Architect, where Enterprise Architecture is the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and improving the key requirements, principles, and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution and transformation.<a href="http://austintexas.gov">[3]</a> The architect accomplishes this value by process definition, integration, requirements, structures and culture change - the city defined purpose.

<p>I'd recommend removing IT from official titles of Enterprise Architects. If, however, your IT Enterprise Architects are actually, system or solution architects, then retitle these position accordingly. In order to grow and garner leadership support, we must help people understand what EA is. Titling our architects as IT Enterprise Architect confuses the actual purpose and value of the enterprise architecture practice.
