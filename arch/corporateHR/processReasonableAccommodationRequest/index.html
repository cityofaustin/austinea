<p><b>Scope: </b>Original Applicant or Agent of Applicant submits a RequestAccommodation (which includes the following information: name of applicant, address of applicant, name of property owner, address of property owner, property address, date of request, description of the request, reason for request) through the City’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) website as a downloadable PDF or in writing using a paper form submitted to any City Employee.<p></p>
If the Applicant needs assistance to submit a RequestAccommodation, the receiving department/employee provides assistance transcribing a verbal request into a written request.  An eligible Applicant is a person with a qualified disability as defined by the Fair housing act. An eligible Applicant can request an expedited review of the RequestAccommodation.
The City processes the request in less than 30 calendar days.  If the City fails to process a request, including internal reviews, in less than 30 calendar days, the RequestAccommodation is automatically granted. The RequestAccommodation becomes "closed - time elapsed".<p></p>
The City Department receiving the RequestAccommodation sends completed form to the ADA office electronically via email. The ADA office reviews the case and upon determination of eligibility, eligible RequestAccommodations are sent electronically via email to the appropriate Department Director Designee(s) The RequestAccommodation is in an "active" state. If ADA office determines the RequestAccommodation is ineligible for consideration, the ADA office sends notification to Applicant of rejection, informing applicant of reason for rejection and the process for submission of supporting documentation by the Applicant. The RequestAccommodation becomes "pending" in the event of a rejection. There is always a 30 day window. The time pauses at the time of rejection. The Applicant can submit further documentation to the ADA for re-review of the initial rejected RequestAccommodation and the 30 day clock will continue. The ADA office can either accept or reject the RequestAccommodation resubmittal. If rejected the RequestAccommodation again becomes "pending" and the 30 day clock is paused and the Applicant can submit more documentation for review. If the Applicant does not submit additional documentation within 30 calendar days of request the RequestAccommodation becomes "closed - no activity"".<p></p>
The Department Director Designee(s) reviews the RequestAccommodation and issues a WrittenDecision (including reasons and factors of consideration) to the Applicant and City ADA Office prior to the expiration of the 30 calendar day approval window. There are instances when a reviewing department does not respond within 30 calendar days so the request is granted and the Applicant is notified by the Department Designee in writing. If the Department Director Designee receives an expedited review from Applicant, the Department Director Designee will take action to accommodate the expedited review request. If necessary to reach a determination, the Department Director Designee can ask for InformationRequest (additional documentation) from the Applicant consistent with fair housing amendment act (FHAA) and the 30 calendar day period is on hold until the Applicant responds to the InformationRequest. If the RequestAccommodation result is a WrittenDecision the state of the RequestAccommodation is "closed - written decision".<p></p>
In the event of conflict of approval/denial  or a unanimous denial by all involved department(s), a formal review by Legal, ADA, and involved Departments (including Austin 311, Development Services Department, Planning and Zoning Department, Austin Code Department, Watershed Department) is convened for final disposition prior to the 30 calendar day expiration. All interested parties must come to a unanimous decision. If the decision is a denial, the City Manager’s Office and Legal review risks of denial resulting in either upholding the denial or approval of original RequestAccommodation. Written notification of final determination is sent to applicant and the ADA office. If review is not completed before the expiration of 30 calendar day period the request is automatically approved. If the RequestAccommodation results in a written notification the state of the RequestAccommodation is "closed - with review".<p></p>
If the Department Director Designee finds the RequestAccommodation imposes an undue financial or administrative burden on the City, or requires a fundamental alteration in the City's land use and zoning regulations, the Department Director Designee searches for an alternative reasonable accommodation that meets the RequestAccommodation needs. An alternative reasonable accommodation can be the original RequestAccommodation with conditions added. The Department Director Designee notifies the City Law Department and CMO of the alternative reasonable accommodation. Notification is sent to the applicant by the department(s) stipulating condition(s). If the RequestAccommodation results in an alternative request accommodation the state of the RequestAccommodation is "closed with alternative".
