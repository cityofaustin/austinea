<p><b>Scope: </b>The system provides Department Human Resource representatives the ability to customize a set of criteria to establish eligibility to receive safety incentive bonus. For each city department, the system provides for a new set of eligibility criteria to apply to their safety incentive program. Incentives include a select number of documented positive behaviors that go beyond day-to-day duties. Based on safety Incentive Criteria determined by Department Human Resources, the Supervisor tracks certain modifiable elements such as positive behaviors (beyond normal) to associate with the Employee Safety Record. The Department Human Resources uses the system to generate a safety Incentive Report to identify eligible Employees to receive safety incentive bonus. The report must be in electronic format.</p>
