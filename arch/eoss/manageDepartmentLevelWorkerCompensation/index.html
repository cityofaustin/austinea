<p><b>Scope: </b>When an Employee is injured on the job or a change in work status occurs based on a previous injury, the Employee provides the Worker Compensation Representative a completed DWC-73 form. The Worker Compensation Representative uses the system and information on the form to create and/or update a Worker Status. When the Employee gains full work status, the Worker Compensation Representative uses the system to create a WC803 Denial Form for processing by the Human Resources Wage Continuation Coordinator. The Worker Compensation Representative uses Work Status information and Webstract to create a DWC-6 form. For certain claims, the Worker Compensation Representative uses Banner to look up Employee salary information. This information is used by the Worker Compensation Representative to create a DWC-3 form using Webstract. The Worker Compensation Representative sends DWC-73, 6, 3 forms depending on the disposition of the Employee to a Third Party Administrator for claims processing. Using the system, the Worker Compensation Representative scans relevant documentation for inclusion with the Employee Work Status.</p>
