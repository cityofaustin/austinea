<p><b>Scope: </b>The Safety Investigator uses a mobile device to retrieve the assigned Incident Report using a link in the Notification. The Safety Investigator uses the mobile devise to review and edit the Incident Report as required to perform the investigation. The Incident Investigator uses the system to establish an Incident Investigation, which is associated to the Incident Report. The Incident Investigator uses a mobile device and the system to enter Incident Investigation information based on witness testimony. The Incident Investigator or Supervisor uses the system to attach multimedia files from Incident Event scene using a mobile device. Triggered by changing status of an Incident Event and selected Incident Type, the system automatically notifies a predefined chain of command and Responders via email, text, pager message depending on profile setup and configuration. The Notification distribution uses business rules based on the Incident Type selected.</p>

Witness may include, but not limited to, the Employee, Supervisor, Emergency Responder, and other witness testimony. The system provides a means to upload and link items such as a crash report by Austin Police Department (APD). The incident investigation may include the APD crash report containing an APD Case Number. The Incident Investigator uses the system to enter incident cause and suggested corrective actions. The system provides for a Incident Investigator to complete follow-up interviews with Employee or witnesses. After completion of the investigation and based on the facts, the Incident Investigator identifies the corrective actions (employee, department, disposition) triggering Implement Corrective Safety Action.</td>
