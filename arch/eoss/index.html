<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/administerSafetyTraining/">Administer Safety Training</a>: When department leadership identify training needs to accommodate corrective action, new process, standard procedures, equipment use or regulatory change, the Training Coordinator uses the system to associate training requirements (course needs, media review, testing needs, etc.) for an individual Employee performing a particular city position. Based on position types, the system identifies specific training needs and their associated time-lines to ensure proper regulatory compliance. The Training Coordinator uses the system to develop and manage training materials. Based on the Training Plan setup by the Training Coordinator, the system tracks training requirements and based on training schedule, generates regular Notifications to Employees to ensure (track) the required training occurs. The system provides Notifications to selected Employees regarding their training needs in the form of Outlook calendar items (or other equivalent indication). The Employee uses the system to accomplish computer-based training while allowing employees to enter relevant metadata for outside training accomplishments.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/establishIncidentReport/">Establish Incident Report</a>: An Employee involved or witness to a reportable Incident Event calls the Dispatcher to report the initial details of the Incident Event. The Dispatcher uses the system to log the initial reported details of the Incident Event, the event location and selects from a list of Incident Types stored in the system. Depending on the Incident Event, the Dispatcher contacts the appropriate Emergency Responder. Triggered by changing status of an Incident Event and selected Incident Type, the system automatically notifies a predefined chain of command and Responders via email, text, pager message depending on profile setup and configuration. The identified Responder acknowledges receipt of the Incident Event (in the Notification) and travels to the notified location. Using a mobile device, the identified Responder indicates arrival on scene by selecting a link in the Incident Event Notification and the system provides status indication to the Dispatcher. Depending on the disposition of the Employee, the Supervisor ensures Employee medical attention by escorting or following the emergency response team to medical treatment facility. Using a mobile device, the system provides the Supervisor a template form to create the initial Incident Report criteria details. Previous information already created by the system such as Incident Event information already logged by the Dispatcher, Acknowledgment and Response Indication pre-populate the Incident Report form. Once the Incident Report is complete, the Supervisor submits the Incident Report. Based on the Incident Type, the system distributes the Incident Report to designated recipients.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/implementCorrectiveSafetyAction/">Implement Corrective Safety Action</a>: For some Incident Events, the Safety Investigator enters Suggested Corrective Actions. This triggers a Notification to the department specific Safety Professional to ensure appropriate corrective safety action. Otherwise, using the system, a Safety Professional enters a Corrective Action and associates the action with a predefined Distribution List. The Distribution List is definable by selected city staff. For identified Corrective Action Respondents, the system sends an action Notification with the details of the Corrective Action required. The Notification also includes delinquent Corrective Actions. The Corrective Action Respondent uses the system to enter the status of the desired Corrective Action.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/manageDriversLicenseVerification/">Manage Drivers License Verification</a>: The system aids the Safety Professional in the management of Employee driver's license when needed by Employees for certain city business. The Safety Professional uses the system to maintain scanned copies associated with Employee's safety record. Using the system, the Safety Professional uploads the State License Report. The system automatically associates traffic violation points and suspension to the identified Employee. The system provides the ability for the Safety Professional to manage expiring driver's licenses to ensure all city drivers operate with up to date driver's licenses.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/manageSafetyIncentiveProgram/">Manage Safety Incentive Program</a>: The system provides Department Human Resource representatives the ability to customize a set of criteria to establish eligibility to receive safety incentive bonus. For each city department, the system provides for a new set of eligibility criteria to apply to their safety incentive program. Incentives include a select number of documented positive behaviors that go beyond day-to-day duties. Based on safety Incentive Criteria determined by Department Human Resources, the Supervisor tracks certain modifiable elements such as positive behaviors (beyond normal) to associate with the Employee Safety Record. The Department Human Resources uses the system to generate a safety Incentive Report to identify eligible Employees to receive safety incentive bonus. The report must be in electronic format.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/manageDepartmentLevelWorkerCompensation/">Manage Department-Level Worker Compensation</a>: When an Employee is injured on the job or a change in work status occurs based on a previous injury, the Employee provides the Worker Compensation Representative a completed DWC-73 form. The Worker Compensation Representative uses the system and information on the form to create and/or update a Worker Status. When the Employee gains full work status, the Worker Compensation Representative uses the system to create a WC803 Denial Form for processing by the Human Resources Wage Continuation Coordinator. The Worker Compensation Representative uses Work Status information and Webstract to create a DWC-6 form. For certain claims, the Worker Compensation Representative uses Banner to look up Employee salary information. This information is used by the Worker Compensation Representative to create a DWC-3 form using Webstract. The Worker Compensation Representative sends DWC-73, 6, 3 forms depending on the disposition of the Employee to a Third Party Administrator for claims processing. Using the system, the Worker Compensation Representative scans relevant documentation for inclusion with the Employee Work Status.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/performIncidentInvestigation/">Perform Incident Investigation</a>: The Safety Investigator uses a mobile device to retrieve the assigned Incident Report using a link in the Notification. The Safety Investigator uses the mobile devise to review and edit the Incident Report as required to perform the investigation. The Incident Investigator uses the system to establish an Incident Investigation, which is associated to the Incident Report. The Incident Investigator uses a mobile device and the system to enter Incident Investigation information based on witness testimony. The Incident Investigator or Supervisor uses the system to attach multimedia files from Incident Event scene using a mobile device. Triggered by changing status of an Incident Event and selected Incident Type, the system automatically notifies a predefined chain of command and Responders via email, text, pager message depending on profile setup and configuration. The Notification distribution uses business rules based on the Incident Type selected.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/performSafetyInspectionAndAudits/">Perform Safety Inspection and Audits</a>: The system provides the Safety Professional a checklist-oriented entry form for inspection items using a mobile device. The form and related items must be modifiable by selected city staff. For vehicle inspection, the Driver uses a radio frequency identification (RFID) mobile scanner (or similar technology) to perform a pre-trip inspection. For recurring inspections, the system automatically notifies relevant Safety Professions of routine inspection events. The system provides the Safety Professional the ability to set inspection notifications depending on the disposition of the inspection item - i.e., delay or change inspection schedule. The system provides for ergonomic inspections based on new employee setup, Employee requests, Physician requests, or Worker Compensation Representative through an Ergonomics Self Evaluation Form (Industrial and Administrative Ergonomic).</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/eoss/respondToDrugAndAlcoholTestRequest">Respond to Drug and Alcohol Test Request</a>: The Department Alcohol and Drug Coordinator uses the system to create an Alcohol and Drug Test indication for selected Employee. The system notifies the appropriate staff (based on the test type) of alcohol and drug test need. The Supervisor transports the Employee to designated medical facility for all test Types except pre-employment. The Employee completes an Alcohol or Drug test at a designated medical facility. The medical facility forwards test results to Human Resources Alcohol and Drug Coordinator for distribution. The Department Alcohol and Drug Coordinator receives Test Results from HR Alcohol and Drug Coordinator. The Department Alcohol and Drug Coordinator updates the Alcohol and Drug Test with the results provided by the HR Alcohol and Drug Coordinator.</p>
