<p><b>Scope: </b>When department leadership identify training needs to accommodate corrective action, new process, standard procedures, equipment use or regulatory change, the Training Coordinator uses the system to associate training requirements (course needs, media review, testing needs, etc.) for an individual Employee performing a particular city position. Based on position types, the system identifies specific training needs and their associated time-lines to ensure proper regulatory compliance. The Training Coordinator uses the system to develop and manage training materials. Based on the Training Plan setup by the Training Coordinator, the system tracks training requirements and based on training schedule, generates regular Notifications to Employees to ensure (track) the required training occurs. The system provides Notifications to selected Employees regarding their training needs in the form of Outlook calendar items (or other equivalent indication). The Employee uses the system to accomplish computer-based training while allowing employees to enter relevant metadata for outside training accomplishments.</p>

Training materials include, but not limited to, slide presentations, videos, and other media needed to convey the information required - much of the training material is Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant. The system includes the ability to create and manage testing material to ensure satisfactory Employee understanding. The system tracks the status of an Employee engagement such as Not Started, In Progress or Completed - includes test results if required and allows the city staff to establish pass or fail thresholds.</td>
