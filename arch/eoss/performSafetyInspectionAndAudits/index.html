<p><b>Scope: </b>The system provides the Safety Professional a checklist-oriented entry form for inspection items using a mobile device. The form and related items must be modifiable by selected city staff. For vehicle inspection, the Driver uses a radio frequency identification (RFID) mobile scanner (or similar technology) to perform a pre-trip inspection. For recurring inspections, the system automatically notifies relevant Safety Professions of routine inspection events. The system provides the Safety Professional the ability to set inspection notifications depending on the disposition of the inspection item - i.e., delay or change inspection schedule. The system provides for ergonomic inspections based on new employee setup, Employee requests, Physician requests, or Worker Compensation Representative through an Ergonomics Self Evaluation Form (Industrial and Administrative Ergonomic).</p>

<td>The system provides the Safety Professional a checklist-oriented entry form for inspection items using a mobile device. The form and related items must be modifiable by selected city staff. For vehicle inspection, the Driver uses a radio frequency identification (RFID) mobile scanner (or similar technology) to perform a pre-trip inspection. The Driver scans RFID devices located in positions of observed inspection to indicate successful condition observation. The Driver uses the mobile device to indicate any discrepant observations and digitally sign indicating completed inspection. [Technology opportunity: Select mobile hand-held device that allows media capture of inspection item or other uses.] The entry form includes indication of Corrective Actions required - the system assigns Corrective Actions implemented by Implement Corrective Safety Action.</td>

<td>The system provides for ergonomic inspections based on new employee setup, Employee requests, Physician requests, or Worker Compensation Representative through an Ergonomics Self Evaluation Form (Industrial and Administrative Ergonomic). The Safety Inspector uses the system to schedule a meeting with the Employee, inspects the area, completes immediate corrective actions (general setup, personal adjustments based on Employee), creates a report which notifies the Chain of Command (report identifies corrective actions already implemented or future corrective actions). Depending on the disposition of the Safety Inspection, may trigger Implement Corrective Safety Action.</td>
