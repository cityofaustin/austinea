<p><b>Scope: </b>The Department Alcohol and Drug Coordinator uses the system to create an Alcohol and Drug Test indication for selected Employee. The system notifies the appropriate staff (based on the test type) of alcohol and drug test need. The Supervisor transports the Employee to designated medical facility for all test Types except pre-employment. The Employee completes an Alcohol or Drug test at a designated medical facility. The medical facility forwards test results to Human Resources Alcohol and Drug Coordinator for distribution. The Department Alcohol and Drug Coordinator receives Test Results from HR Alcohol and Drug Coordinator. The Department Alcohol and Drug Coordinator updates the Alcohol and Drug Test with the results provided by the HR Alcohol and Drug Coordinator.</p>
