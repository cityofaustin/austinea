<p><b>Scope: </b>A Requester uses the system to describe suggested or modified Data Set Requests. The system places the Data Set Request into a Review Queue and notifies select city Intake Staff for completeness review or clarity request. The system ensures Requester understands difference between a public information request and a request to suggest or modify a Data Set. The Intake Staff use the system to manage the open collaboration of the Data Set Request. Using system logs, the system tracks the activity of the Data Set Request from submission through completion for all dispositions of the Data Set Request. The system uses social media like functions to allow Data Set community collaboration on select Data Set Requests. The system provides searchable retrieval of historic requests. Using the system, the Intake Staff assigns Data Set Requests to select city Data Set Responders and allows delegation within assigned owner departments. Finally, when a qualified Data Set is available, the Data Set Responder uses the system to upload Data Set for Requester and Data Set community use.

<td>The system provides and introductory description between a Data Set request and a Public Information Request (PIR) to include a link to PIR submission when justified. The Requester uses the system to acknowledge the distinction between a PIR and a Data Set request prior to Data Set form presentation. City policy ensures PIR response within prescribed periods; therefore, this requires clarity to reduce confusion and manage Requester expectation - i.e., confusing a PIR with a Data Set request. When a Requester requests a suggested or modified Data Set using the system, the Requester completes an entry form to include name, address, email address, desired username and phone number. The system allows for incomplete entries (ex., organizational affiliation, business, name, address, phone, etc. are not required). However, the system requires a valid email address. The system validates Requester email by sending a confirmation code to the Requester email address - the Requester must use the system to validate email ownership. The Requester uses the system provided form to explain the Data Set suggestion or modification. The system provides ability to attach additional documents prior to submission.</td>

Other system responses include data set already published (include information link), indication of a public information request (include link to PIR site), and notification of none existent Data Set (i.e., current city systems do not collect Data Set Request). The system provides community visibility into response to requests and indexes requests for search and discovery. The Intake Staff may use the system to expose the Data Set Request to the Data Set community to allow for likes, voting, comments such as suggested improvements, etc. - the system provides social media like functions to allow collaborative dialog within the data portal community. The system allows community members to contribute to the original request until agreement. City staff (i.e., Data Set Responders) may participate in the collaboration to guide and ensure a reasonable and achievable requests. Participants such as Requesters, Intake Staff, and/or Data Set Responders may invite others to join the collaboration activity, which requires registration with the system (i.e., conformed email address).</td>
