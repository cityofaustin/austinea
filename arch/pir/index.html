<p><b>Scope: </b>Intake Staff review Requester Information Request for clarity and completeness. Requester may submit for information using multiple methods to include email, letter or using the city's Web portal. Submissions enter into a queue for review. Intake Staff may notify Requester for clarity of request. The Intake Staff assign PIR Responders from various departments to collect information. The PIR Responder use the system to determine fee or fee estimate for complex Information Requests. Requester submits a fee to cover expense for accepted and approved information requests. Simple information requests do not require a fee. Once adjudication of fee occurs (if required), The PIR Responders assemble the Information Request. After review of the material for completeness, the system delivers requested information to the Requester.

<td>When a Requester makes an Information Request using the city's Web portal, the Requester completes the entry form to include name, address, email address and phone number. The system allows for incomplete entries (ex., organizational affiliation, business, name, address, phone, etc. are not required) for the Information Request. When using the Web portal, however, the system requires a valid email address for an anonymous submission. The system validates Requester email by sending a confirmation code to the Requester email address - the Requester must use the system to validate email ownership. The system provides ability to attach additional documents with the Information Request. The Requester uses the Web portal to make an Information Request and indicate preferred delivery method (ex., Web portal, hard copy, or other media such as compact disc). The system defaults to deliver Information Request items electronically through the Web portal or emailed with attachments depending on the requested item. The volume of some Information Request items necessitate electronic delivery such a video files. The system provides the Requester the ability to indicate pickup method such as Web portal, physical pickup, mail to postal service address, or email. For non-Web submission such as written letter, other paper submission or email, the Intake Staff uses the system to complete the entry form on behalf of the Requester. Intake Staff use the system for all Intake Request items no matter the source. Intake Staff enters all the text information into the system, scans or converts the submission (ex., email) to Portable Document Format (PDF) and uses the system to attach the PDF document to the Information Request entry. To manage Requester expectation, the system provides conformation using a system generated email or letter summarizing city contact information, anticipated process and/or any associated costs.</td>

<td>For Web portal submissions, the system generates an email containing the Information Clarity Request. Within the email, the system provides a URL link to direct the Requester to a form to add clarity description associated with the original request. The Web link expires after set period adjustable by approved city staff. At some adjustable set period, the system sends a secondary notice to the Requester prior to link expiration. The original Web submission remains intact while the added submission acts as an additional submission (addendum to the request). The system provides the Requester an option to include document attachments to the Clarity Request. There are no limits to the number of additional Clarity Requests by the system. Clarity requests may occur anytime during the PIR Responder activity. At any phase in the Information Request process, the PIR Responder may request additional clarity. The system identifies and stores with the Information Request the identity of the requesting city staff. Clarity descriptions are visible to all PIR Responders and Intake Staff assigned to the Information Request task. The Requester may respond in writing or by email to a clarity request - in this situation, the Intake Staff enters the clarity response into the system and attaches a PDF version of the original. Approved staff members use the system to observe the historic dialog between Requester, Intake Staff and other PIR Staff clarity dialog. The system provides Intake Staff and PIR Responder the ability to enter viewable notes shared among the task participants, but not viewable or released to the Requester. The Notification informs Requester of a required fee and informs Requester when Information Request is ready for pickup or delivery.</td>

Information log include activities, dates/time and responsible staff details, etc. The system provides commonly used PIR Responder templates modifiable by approved city staff. The system provides summary guidance for the Intake Staff to select the appropriate template based on the type and scope of the Information Request. The Intake Staff use the system to add or remove department PIR Respondent on selected templates as needed. Once satisfied with the PIR Responder list, the Intake Staff use the system to submit PIR Responder tasks.

<td>Departments gather information based on the Information Request and clarity response in various formats. The system aids in delivering common formats viewable by the Requester without specialized applications - good examples include Portable Document Format (PDF). In some circumstances, Intake Staff and/or PIR Responder print hardcopy or copy media to CD ROM for Requester pickup. The PIR Responder uses the system to attach the information requested to the assigned information request task (by unique identifier). The system allows for links (i.e., Uniform Resource Locator - URL) for information sources visible and accessible to the Requester when released. The system ensures all Information Request tasks are associated and reported in consistent form using a unique identification relationship to include status of department assignments. PIR Requester gathered information is visible to the unique identification Information Request while maintaining visible relationship with other department PIR Requester responses. The system provides overview of all Information Request task assignment status and information collected. The system provides Intake Staff continuous status indication throughout the Information Request lifecycle. Assembly is where material is reviewed for releasability, personal identification information, and confidentiality, etc. - for sensitive material, the system tracks approving official when indicated or non-releasable material. The system provides tools to redact select information.</td>

<td>Guided by a URL link in a Notification, the system provides the Requester a URL link to a Web portal containing additional URL(s) referencing the information requested. Similar to a Clarity Request, the Notification of delivery times out after a prescribed period. The time out period is adjustable by approved city staff. In addition, the system sends additional Notification at a set period reminding Requester of expiration date. The system provides Intake Staff the ability to override and/or reset expiration. The system allows Intake Staff to include multiple instances of Requester. The system does not expose multiple instances to other requesters. At any time, the Intake Staff may use the system to resurrect a closed Information Request reassign to one more instances of additional requesters. For hand delivery option, the Intake Staff use the system to create paper copies of the Information Request or digital copies on Requester desired media. The Intake Staff use the system to close the Information Request when warranted or the closure occurs during period end.</td>
