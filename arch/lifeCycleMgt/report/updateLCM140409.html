<p>I understand the life-cycle management group is no longer interested in pursuing the enterprise architecture (EA) ontology to assist in asset lifecycle management. It's too bad you've made this determination after just two meetings - well before the EA approach begins to bear fruit. This supports my premise that EA needs to be involved early and have leadership support; otherwise, there's a sense of do-over or the solution appears too far in the distance to be useful to the more immediate concerns. This is a frequent EA challenge... The notion of enterprise ontology provides a chance to make a fresh start, to bring approaches to the (re)designing and (re)engineering of enterprises to a higher level of quality. In order to achieve this, one has to find a way to separate the stable ontological essence of an enterprise from the variable way in which it is realized and implemented. This is the only hope for mastering the diversity and complexity in contemporary enterprises. What is not yet understood by our city is the concepts of realization and implementation and all other concepts have a well-defined place. As a result, the need for immediate solutions always usurps the larger vision leading to less optimal employments handed down to future generations to fix later and these fixes need to be accomplished with little to no documentation (i.e., architecture).</p>

<p>In case you find our previous work useful, below is our EA work to date:</p>

<tr>
<td>Vision</td>
<td>Provide City Manager, policy-makers, and public with appropriate information on the costs of procuring, leasing, operating and maintaining assets, to make fully informed decisions in the capital improvement planning and operational budgeting processes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Capability/<br />Identify Realistic Costs of Operating and Maintaining City Infrastructure</td>
<td>Identify costs of operating and maintaining existing city infrastructure to meet planned performance levels of service. Provide a means for city leadership and policy makers to optimally plan for asset costs over its life-span and use the information in long-range planning, budgeting decision-making and inform the public.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goal/<br />Determine how to balance life-cycle cost with expected levels of service</td>
<td>Though they are an important factor in decision-making, life-cycle costs are only one factor, and must be included in a larger conversation of other factors associated with asset management that can affect overall asset cost and ultimate asset life-span. The cost of an asset throughout its useful life must to be balanced with issues such as expected levels of service for any given asset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goal/<br />Standardize and collect life-cycle cost data across the city</td>
<td>The current City business planning and five-year capital improvement planning (CIP) financial processes are logical vehicles for compiling such information, since both processes link into the City’s budgeting process. However, additional work is needed to determine how to collect life-cycle cost data across the city and integrated into the existing processes. The approach to life-cycle costing may vary for assets that are fixed in one location (e.g., a building or a road) and assets that are mobile (e.g., vehicles and computers). Any effort to put a standardized approach in place for life-cycle costing must consider these differences. The Life-Cycle Management Task Force develops a standardized framework for calculating and using life-cycle cost information related to all infrastructure owned and managed by the City of Austin, with the full understanding that each department's approach to life-cycle costing may vary somewhat based on the department's mission and operations. The Task Force's approach includes further assessment of existing asset management and life-cycle cost processes and systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goal/<br />Integrate life-cycle cost information into existing budgeting processes</td>
<td>For an effective enterprise life-cycle management capability, integrate department asset information sources standardized in conformance with the desired reporting needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goal/<br />Define information needs, information interfaces, use descriptions, and processes</td>
<td>Use Enterprise Architecture (EA) to logically define information needs, information interfaces, use descriptions, and processes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goal/<br />Determine social, economic, and environmental life-cycle costs to optimize decision-making in context of community interest</td>
<td>Managed capital and operational planning from city organizational viewpoint by optimizing a balance between social, economic and environmental cost and values to provide stakeholders with a defensible proposal on asset expenditures.
[Create a standardized framework for the calculation and use of life-cycle cost information. Identify the type of data needed for reporting and decision-making purposes. Reporting requirements definition is a key component and challenge going forward.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goal/<br />Evaluate external and internal city department life-cycle cost systems and processes to determine potential options</td>
<td>Both internal departments and external agencies are using a variety of technology systems and tools to collect and track life-cycle cost data. These systems range from spreadsheets to more sophisticated asset management systems. These systems are evaluated as organizational life-cycle cost framework and processes are developed to determine potential options for the most efficient collection of life-cycle cost data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goal/<br />Establish required policies or governance to support life-cylce asset management citywide</td>
<td>Similar to IT governance, citywide asset life-cycle management can not succeed without ensuring consistent implementation of city approved plans.</td>
