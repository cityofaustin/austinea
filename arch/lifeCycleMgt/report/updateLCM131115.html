<p>I created the following Capabability Model that describes a Life-Cycle Management Task Force set of goals to establish the capability to <i>Identify Accurate Costs of Operating and Maintaining City Infrastructure</i> - please select to enlarge. The following table provides a description of each goal. You'll notice some dependency relationships between the goals. Read the arrows backwards becuase the arrows do not represnet flow; rather, the arrows represent dependency i.e., the arrow points to the dependent goals - ex., <i>Determine life-cycle cost reporting needs</i> depends on <i>Define information needs, information interfaces, use descriptions, and processes</i>.</p>

<tr><th>Goal</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Determine life-cycle cost reporting needs</td>
<td>Use a standardized framework for the calculation and use of life-cycle cost information greatly depend on the type of data needed for reporting and decision-making purposes. Reporting requirements definition is a key component and challenge going forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Define information needs, information interfaces, use descriptions, and processes</td>
<td>Use Enterprise Architecture (EA) to logically define information needs, information interfaces, use descriptions, and processes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Integrate life-cycle cost information into existing budgeting processes</td>
<td>For an effective life-cycle management capability, the information sources must be integrated with department information sources and cleansed (i.e., normalized) in conformance with the desired reporting needs. The Task Force uses Enterprise Architecture (EA) to model the interfaces and information needs to define information sources in compliance with life-cycle reporting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Evaluate external and internal city department life-cycle cost systems and processes to determine potential options</td>
<td>Both internal departments and external agencies are using a variety of technology systems and tools to collect and track life-cycle cost data. These systems range from spreadsheets to more sophisticated asset management systems. These systems are evaluated as organizational life-cycle cost framework and processes are developed to determine potential options for the most efficient collection of life-cycle cost data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Normalize and collect life-cycle cost data across the city</td>
<td>The current City business planning and five-year capital improvement planning (CIP) financial processes are logical vehicles for compiling such information, since both processes link into the City’s budgeting process. However, additional work is needed to determine how to collect life-cycle cost data across the city and integrated into the existing processes. The approach to life-cycle costing may vary for assets that are fixed in one location (e.g., a building or a road) and assets that are mobile (e.g., vehicles and computers). Any effort to put a standardized approach in place for life-cycle costing must consider these differences. The Life-Cycle Management Task Force develops a standardized framework for calculating and using life-cycle cost information related to all infrastructure owned and managed by the City of Austin, with the full understanding that each department's approach to life-cycle costing may vary somewhat based on the department's mission and operations. The Task Force's approach includes further assessment of existing asset management and life-cycle cost processes and systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Determine how to balance life-cycle cost with expected levels of service</td>
<td>Though they are an important factor in decision-making, life-cycle costs are only one factor, and must be included in a larger conversation of other factors associated with asset management that can affect overall asset cost and ultimate asset life-span. The cost of an asset throughout its useful life must to be balanced with issues such as expected levels of service for any given asset.</td>
