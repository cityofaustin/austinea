<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer looks up and verifies case information in the system. The Austin Code Officer then creates a CodeViolationCase in the system. The system updates the CodeComplaintCase to link it to the new CodeViolationCase. Several options are then available to the Austin Code Officer based on the disposition and requirements of the CodeViolationCase:
<br>
<ul><li>If emergency response is required, the Engage Emergency Response use case begins.
<li>If the Violation involves zoning or land use, the Inspect Zoning Land Use Violation use case begins.
<li>If the Violation involves a dangerous or substandard Violation, the Inspect Structure Code Violation use case begins.
<li>If new Violations are identified at the same Location, the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with the new Violations.
<li>If new Violations are identified at different Locations (typically a neighbor, etc.), the Create Code Complaint Case use case is used to create CodeComplaintCases for each Violation at the new Locations.
<li>If the Property has a history of Violations, the Inspect Repeat Offender Violation use case begins.
<li>If a Warning is warranted, the Austin Code Officer issues a Warning to the Violator.
<li>If a Citation is warranted, the Austin Code Officer begins the Issue Violation Citation use case.
<li>If a NoticeOfViolation hasn't been created previously for the Violation and is required, the Send Notice of Violation use case begins.
<li>If Owner hardship is present, the Provide Community Outreach Assistance use case begins.</li></ul>

The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase in the system with notes of their actions. Finally, if Complainant information is available and contact is warranted, the Austin Code Officer contacts the Complainant with their findings.
