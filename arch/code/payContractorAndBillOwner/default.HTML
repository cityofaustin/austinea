<p><b>Scope: </b>A Contractor provides an Austin Code Program Specialist with an invoice detailing the work completed. The Austin Code Program Specialist updates the CodeViolationCase with information on the invoice, and then evaluates the invoice to ensure it aligns with the work requested. If the Contractor is Texas Industries for the Blind and Handicapped (TIBH) (Easter Seals is a subcontractor), and changes in the field create a change to the invoice amount, the Austin Code Program Specialist uses the Case Management System to look up and verify case information. The Austin Code Program Specialist then requests the Austin Code Officer verify that the invoice matches the work completed for the property. If the Austin Code Officer doesn't approve the new amount, the Austin Code Officer requests the Austin Code Program Specialist to request an invoice change from the Contractor. The Austin Code Program Specialist sends the invoice-change request, and the Contractor submits a revised invoice. The Austin Code Program Specialist updates the CodeViolationCase with additional invoice information or revised invoice(s). If an emergency board and secure occurred, the Austin Code Program Specialist requests the Austin Code Officer to approve the invoice and signs as "OK to pay." The Austin Code Program Specialist requests the Austin Code Admin Manager to review and approve the invoice. If approved, the Austin Code Admin Manager sends an InvoiceApprovalMemo to Austin Code Finance and requests payment to the Contractor. Austin Code Finance initiates the Pay Invoice use case. If the property work completed was private, the Austin Code Program Specialist uses the Case Management System to create a BillNotice. If the bill is over $1000 and there isn't a homestead exemption for the property, then a lien is placed on the property (Place Lien on Property use case). The Austin Code Program Specialist requests Austin Code Finance to create a receivable. The Austin Code Finance then issues the bill to the Owner via regular mail.
