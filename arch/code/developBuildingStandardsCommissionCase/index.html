<p><b>Scope:</b></p>
<p>A CodeViolationCase that requires review by the
Building and Standards Commission initiates the Verify Title use case.
An Austin Code Officer requests a TitleSearch. Once the TitleSearch is
returned the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase.</p>
<p>After the TitleSearch the Create BSC Packet use
case begins. The Austin Code Officer requests BSCMaps for the
CodeViolationCase, and then assembles a BSCPacket. The BSCPacket
receives multiple levels of review including the Austin Code Officer's
direct Chain of Command, the Assistant Division Manager, and the Austin
Code Legal Officer. If changes are required at any point the BSCPacket
is returned to the Austin Code Officer for updates. Once approved, the
Austin Code Legal Coordinator coordinates a BSCPacket case review.</p>
<p>The Perform Building Standards Commission Review
use case starts after the BSCPacket is approved. The Austin Code Legal
Coordinator creates a BSCAgenda, develops a BSCPresentation, and
conducts pre-meetings in preparation for the Building and Standards
Commission. The Building and Standards Commission reviews the BSCPacket
and makes a BSCDetermination: defer a decision or accept the
recommendation. If a decision is deferred, the Perform Building
Standards Commission Review use case restarts at the deferred time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the decision is accepted the Building and
Standards Commission may opt to alter the recommendation, or keep the
original recommendation. An Order is created, signed, and notarized.
Orders are for repairs, or demolition, and specify a time frame to be
completed. If the Responsible Party doesn't comply to the Order the
LegalCase is brought back to the Building and Standards Commission for
review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Responsible Party doesn't display an
initiative to comply to the Order, and the Order is for a demolition
the Austin Code Legal Coordinator coordinates the demolition process
with Public Works, notifies utilities to disconnect services, and
requests verification of the demolition by an Austin Code Officer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Property is within compliance and all
penalties are paid for the Order, the LegalCase is closed. If not, the
Perform Building Standards Commission Review use case restarts.</p>

<td>If the violation concerns hazardous

Equipment (PPE). The Austin Code Officer inspects the Property. The
Austin Code Officer inspects from the exterior (initially from the
right of way) to the interior (if the interior is accessible and
permission has been granted by legally interested party or someone in
Care/Control of Property). The Austin Code Officer takes photographs
and measurements as needed (hot water temperature, air quality,
interior temperature, light meter, ground-fault circuit interrupter,
gas meter, carbon monoxide, smoke detector, fences, grass height,
driveway and walkways, checks impervious cover, etc.). As needed, the
Austin Code Officer performs research to identify the Property Owner,
offense, ViolationType, OwnerInformation, and relevant
PropertyInformation (GIS system, ARR Site, annexation information,
AMANDA permit history, site plan, TCAD/WCAD for OwnerHistory and
DeedHistory, CC&amp;B, ZoningHistory, CodeOfOrdinances, etc.). The
Austin Code Officer interviews relevant parties. For Waste Hauler
Inspection: The Austin Code Officer makes contact with driver, visually
inspects vehicle for decals on door, asks driver about awareness
requirement for waste hauler license, ensures driver is operating
within City of Austin (outside of city is exempt), double checks the
Waste Hauler license, checks for safety-equipment violations, driver's
license of driver, and takes photos of truck (including both doors and
front license plate). If a short-term rental complaint, the Austin Code
Officer responds more quickly than other complaints. On Fridays and
Saturdays, the Austin Code Officer performs inspection during day, and
from 6:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. On Sundays, inspections occur from 8:00 a.m.
- 12:00 p.m.</td>
