<p><b>Scope: </b>An Austin Code Officer identifies a potential Repeat Offender. The Austin Code Officer determines if the Property and Responsible Party qualify as a Repeat Offender; the Austin Code Officer reviews the Property case history, Citations, and NoticeOfViolations to see if Repeat Offender criteria has been met (two Citations in two years, or five NoticeOfViolations in two years, or two Violations not met in a timely manner in two years). The Austin Code Officer creates a RepeatOffenderPacket and sends the RepeatOffenderPacket to the Chain of Command for review.
If the Chain of Command disagrees with the Repeat Offender identification, or requires changes, the use case ends.
If the Chain of Command agrees with the Repeat Offender identification, the Chain of Command schedules a Repeat Offender evaluation with the ROP Review Committee and requests the ROP Review Committee evaluate the Repeat Offender.
If the ROP Review Committee rejects the Repeat Offender identification, the use case ends.
If the ROP Review Committee accepts the Repeat Offender identification, the Chain of Command requests the Austin Code Program Specialist update the RepeatOffenderList. The Austin Code Program Specialist then creates a RepeatOffenderCase in the Case Management System. The Austin Code Program Specialist sends notice to the Responsible Party to register as a Repeat Offender and updates the RepeatOffenderCase with the sent notice.
If the Responsible Party appeals the Repeat Offender identification, they send an appeal Notification (letter) to Austin Code. The Chain of Command reviews the appeal. If the appeal is denied, then the Director reviews the appeal as a final check. The Austin Code Program Specialist sends the appeal decision to the Responsible Party (approved or denied). If the appeal was approved, the Austin Code Program Specialist updates the RepeatOffenderCase, closes the RepeatOffenderCase, and the use case ends.
Once notified, the Responsible Party has 14 days to register. If the Responsible Party doesn't register within 14 days, the Austin Code Officer issues a Warning. The Austin Code Officer issues a Citation per the Issue Violation Citation use case, if the Responsible Party still doesn't register.
The Responsible Party post Signs at the Property and submits the RepeatOffenderApplication to Austin Code, including payment. Austin Code Finance receives the payment and application, begins the Process Payment use case, and forwards the RepeatOffenderApplication to the Austin Code Program Specialist. The Austin Code Program Specialist records the Repeat Offender's registration and updates the RepeatOffenderCase. The Austin Code Program Specialist then sends the RepeatOffenderLicense to the Repeat Offender.
After the Repeat Offender has registered, the Chain of Command requests the Public Information Office Admin update the RepeatOffenderWebsite. The Public Information Office Admin in turn requests the GIS Analyst to update the RepeatOffenderMap for use on the RepeatOffenderWebsite.
The Austin Code Officer performs follow-up Inspections on the Repeat Offender, per Ordinance. The Austin Code Officer gathers information to include in the RepeatOffenderSummaryReport, and updates the RepeatOffenderCase in the Case Management System. If any Violations are identified during the Inspection, the Austin Code Officer starts the Create Code Violation use case. The Austin Code Officer then requests the Austin Code Program Specialist send the RepeatOffenderSummaryReport to the Owner and Responsible Party.
If the Repeat Offender satisfies the requirements for the Repeat Offender program, the Austin Code Program Specialist closes the RepeatOffenderCase.
