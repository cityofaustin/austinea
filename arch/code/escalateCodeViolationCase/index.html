<p><b>Scope: </b>Code Violation Cases are reviewed and escalated continually until the Violation is resolved. The Responsible Party may request a Violation resolution extension that triggers the Extend Violation Resolution Time use case. If the Responsible Party does not request an extension, the Austin Code Officer uses the Case Management System to identify Property information to ensure it hasn't changed. The Austin Code Officer then performs an Inspection to see if the Violation is still unresolved. If the Violation is resolved, the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with notes on the resolution, closes the CodeViolationCase, and then closes the CodeComplaintCase per the Close Code Complaint Case use case. If the Violation is not resolved, the Austin Code Officer initiates an appropriate escalation use case per the CodeViolationCase disposition:
<br>
<ul><li>If the Violation is not in compliance, the Austin Code Officer begins the Issue Violation Citation use case.
<li>If the Violation is not in compliance for a structural issue/dangerous condition, the Develop Building Standards Commission Case use case begins.
<li>If a preliminary hearing is required, the Conduct Administrative Hearing use case occurs.
<li>If the Violation is not in compliance and property abatement is required, the Create Abatement List use case is started by the Austin Code Officer to abate the property.
<li>If District Court is necessary, the Austin Code Officer starts the Initiate Court Action use case.</li></ul>
<br>
The Austin Code Officer uses the Case Management System to update the CodeViolationCase with notes on the escalation actions taken regarding the CodeViolationCase.
