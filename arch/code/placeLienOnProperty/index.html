<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Agent determines the need for placing a lien on the property after 30 calendar days from the creation of a bill (invoice). The Austin Code Program Specialist uses the Case Management System to create a LienDocument.  The Case Management System updates the property to attach the LienDocument to the property.  The Austin Code Program Specialist prints the LienDocument, checks to ensure property is not homesteaded (does nothing if homestead exemption is present), and submits the LienDocument to the Chain of Command (Austin Code Admin Manager) for approval. If the lien is approved, the Chain of Command (Austin Code Admin Manager) initials and submits to the next in Chain of Command (Austin Code Director). If the LienDocument is not approved, the Chain of Command (Austin Code Admin Manager) returns the LienDocument to the Austin Code Program Specialist with notes on required changes. The Austin Code Program Specialist recreates the LienDocument until it is approved. After the Chain of Command (Austin Code Director) signs and returns the LienDocument, the Austin Code Program Specialist completes the InterDepartmentPurchaseForm (which includes: list of liens, how many are filed at once, how many liens, filing fees, etc.). The Austin Code Program Specialist sends the InterDepartmentPurchaseForm to the Austin Code Admin Manager to sign off on the form. The Austin Code Program Specialist takes the InterDepartmentPurchaseForm, and all associated LienDocuments, to the Travis County Clerk. The Travis County Clerk prints a receipt for all FilingFees and stamps the form. The LienDocuments remain with the Travis County Clerk. The Austin Code Program Specialist submits the InterDepartmentPurchaseForm to Austin Code Finance to process payment to the Travis County Clerk. After the lien is created by Travis County Clerk, the lien is returned to the Austin Code Program Specialist-included is the TRVNumber. The Austin Code Program Specialist adds the TRVNumber to the CodeViolationCase indicating the lien was successfully placed on the property.
