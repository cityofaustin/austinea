<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer issues an AdminHearingWarning to a Violator. If the Violator refuses to sign the AdminHearingWarning, the Austin Code Officer requests the Austin Code Program Specialist send the NoticeOfViolation instead. The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with their notes.
The AdminHearingWarning provides the Violator 10 days to come into compliance. If the Violator doesn't come into compliance in 10 days, the Austin Code Officer issues an AdminHearingCitation to the Violator. The Austin Code Officer then requests the Austin Code Legal Program Specialist send the NoticeOfCitationIssued letter to the Violator. If the AdminHearingCitation is for a short-term rental, the Austin Code Officer completes the ShortTermRentalChecklist. The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase and creates a LegalCase in the Case Management System.
AdminHearingCitations provide the Violator 10 days to come into compliance and mail in a penalty to avoid the AdminHearing. If the Violator doesn't come into compliance and pay the penalty, the Austin Code Officer creates the AdminHearingPacket, and sends to their Chain of Command for approval. The Chain of Command reviews the AdminHearingPacket, AdminHearingPacketChecklist, and determines if the packet is approved. If not approved, the Chain of Command returns the AdminHearingPacket to the Austin Code Officer for revisions.
If the Chain of Command approves the AdminHearingPacket, they forward the packet to the Austin Code Legal Program Coordinator for review. If changes are required, the Austin Code Legal Program Coordinator sends the packet to the Austin Code Officer for updates. If approved, the Austin Code Legal Program Coordinator sends the packet to the Austin Code Administrative Hearing Coordinator.
The Hearing Coordinator reviews the packet and sends the packet back to the Austin Code Officer if changes are necessary. After the Hearing Coordinator approves the AdminHearingPacket, they update the LegalCase in the Case Management System, schedules the AdminHearing, and conducts a preparatory meeting for the AdminHearing.
During the AdminHearing, the Austin Code Officer presents their case to the Administrative Hearing Officer. The Austin Code Administrative Hearing Coordinator coordinates the AdminHearing, and the Administrative Hearing Officer makes a determination for the AdminHearing (violation present, penalty amount, and if a compliance hearing is necessary). If the Violator doesn't appear at hearing, then an automatic penalty is assessed ($300).
If the AdminHearing decision is Violations are present, the Administrative Hearing Officer issues an AdministrativeOrder. The Austin Code Administrative Hearing Coordinator distributes the AdministrativeOrder to the parties involved. If a ComplianceHearing is deemed necessary, the Administrative Hearing Officer schedules the ComplianceHearing and conducts the ComplianceHearing (along with determining if compliance is being met by the Violator).
If the Violator pays the penalty, the Process Payment use case starts. If the Violator doesn't pay the penalty, the Austin Code Legal Program Coordinator creates a BillNotice in the Case Management System, sends Notification of the BillNotice to the Violator, and the CreateReceivable use case starts to indicate the Violator owes money to the City of Austin.
The Austin Code Legal Program Coordinator updates the LegalCase with notes as necessary. The LegalCase is closed once the Penalty is paid. Until the penalty is paid, the LegalCase remains open.
