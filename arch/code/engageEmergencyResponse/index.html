<p><b>Scope: </b>If a fire, dangerous structure, or natural disaster has occurred, the Austin Code Officer waits for the Property to be released for investigation. Once the Property has been released, the Austin Code Officer determines if assistance services are required. If assistance services are required, the Austin Code Officer starts the Provide Assistance Services use case. If a natural disaster occurred, the Austin code Officer performs an assessment of the damage and notifies the appropriate parties of the assessment. Assessment guidelines and damage classification are provided by FEMA. The Austin Code Officer places temporary caution barriers at the Property, performs an Inspection, and then notifies the Owner to fence and board the property. The Austin Code Officer provides the Owner time to fend and board the Property. If the Owner doesn't fence and board the Property, the Austin Code Officer then starts the Notify Contractor to Board and Secure use case. If APD is required to clear dangers from the Property, the Austin Code Officer contacts APD to clear dangers.

<td>Relocation Services apply to any non-Owner-occupied Property. The Austin Code Officer inspects the Property, and if the Property condition and/or Structural Conditions are substandard (no hot water) or dangerous to the habitability (e.g., collapse hazard, insufficient stabilization, sanitation, etc.), then relocation services are deemed necessary. The Inspector contacts the Owner/Property Manager (preferably in person or by phone) and identifies whether the Owner is capable of providing relocation services. If relocation is required, the Austin Code Officer notifies the Owner and Tenant(s).</td>

<td>If the violation concerns hazardous conditions, the Austin Code Officer uses Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The Austin Code Officer inspects the Property. The Austin Code Officer inspects from the exterior (initially from the right of way) to the interior (if the interior is accessible and permission has been granted by legally interested party or someone in Care/Control of Property). The Austin Code Officer takes photographs and measurements as needed (hot water temperature, air quality, interior temperature, light meter, ground-fault circuit interrupter, gas meter, carbon monoxide, smoke detector, fences, grass height, driveway and walkways, checks impervious cover, etc.). As needed, the Austin Code Officer performs research to identify the Property Owner, offense, ViolationType, OwnerInformation, and relevant PropertyInformation (GIS system, ARR Site, annexation information, AMANDA permit history, site plan, TCAD/WCAD for OwnerHistory and DeedHistory, CC&B, ZoningHistory, CodeOfOrdinances, etc.). The Austin Code Officer interviews relevant parties. For Waste Hauler Inspection: The Austin Code Officer makes contact with driver, visually inspects vehicle for decals on door, asks driver about awareness requirement for waste hauler license, ensures driver is operating within City of Austin (outside of city is exempt), double checks the Waste Hauler license, checks for safety-equipment violations, driver's license of driver, and takes photos of truck (including both doors and front license plate). If a short-term rental complaint, the Austin Code Officer responds more quickly than other complaints. On Fridays and Saturdays, the Austin Code Officer performs inspection during day, and from 6:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. On Sundays, inspections occur from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. 
NOTE: Inspection times for STRs should be updated and are subject to change. </td></tr>
