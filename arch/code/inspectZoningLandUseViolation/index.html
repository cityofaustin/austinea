<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer determines the specific Violation. The Austin Code Officer uses the Case Management system to identify PropertyInformation. The Austin Code Officer completes additional research on LandHistory. If the Violation is a contractor performing work without a permit the Inspector issues a StopWorkOrder. StopWorkOrders are issued at the Austin Code Officer's discretion based on the progress of the work, impact to structure, and public safety. The Austin Code Officer creates a StopWorkOrder, then uses the Case Management System and creates a StopWorkOrderCoverLetter. The Austin Code Officer requests the Austin Code Program Specialist issue a StopWorkOrder, and send it through certified and regular mail. The Austin Code Program Specialist updates the CodeViolationCase with notes on the StopWorkOrder. If the Violation requires a suspension or revocation of a permit/certificate/etc. the Austin Code Officer requests Planning or Development Review research potential suspension or revocation of the appropriate permit/certificate/etc. The Austin Code Officer follows up with Planning or Development Review on the revocation until a decision or resolution is determined. If the Violation is a SignViolation the Austin Code Officer removes the sign. The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with the results of the investigation.
