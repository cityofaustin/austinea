<p><b>Scope: </b>Austin Code Finance receives a payment either by mail or from an Austin Code Program Specialist. If the payment is received through mail, Austin Code Finance processes the payment by opening the mail in pairs with the second staff member acting as an auditor. If payment is received from the Austin Code Program Specialist, a receipt is returned to the Austin Code Program Specialist. Austin Code Finance updates the FinanceTrackingSheet with details about the payment. If a receivable exists for the payment, Austin Code Finance uses AIMS to update the receivable. The payment is then prepared for deposit. For Licensing Payments, the Austin Code Program Specialist prepares the deposit partially and then delivers it to Austin Code Finance to complete the deposit. Austin Code Finance updates the FinanceTrackingSheet, fills the DepositBag, updates the DepositBook, and creates a DepositTicket. Deposits are picked up throughout the business week by a security firm. After the deposit has been picked up, Austin Code Finance uses the BankSearch system to check that the deposit was successfully made to the bank. Once the deposit is verified in BankSearch, Austin Code Finance prints the BankSearch verification. Austin Code Finance uses AIMS to create a CashReceipt, and then assembles a CashReceiptPacket containing the CashReceipt, BankSearch, copies of checks, DepositTicket, etc. Austin Code Finance sends the CashReceiptPacket to the Chain of Command for approval. The Chain of Command approves the CashReceipt in AIMS. If the payment needs to be recorded in the Case Management System, Austin Code Finance updates the appropriate CodeViolationCase with payment details.
