<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer identifies whether the responsible party has a HardshipReason.  If the responsible party is unable to correct the Violation due to hardship, the Austin Code Officer identifies three assistance resources from the CodeResourceList.  The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with notes of the resources identified. If the responsible party does not qualify for assistance with the provided assistance resources, the Austin Code Officer prepares the CommunityOutreachForm.  The Austin Code Officer requests the Chain of Command approve the CommunityOutreachForm.  If the CommunityOutreachForm is not approved, the Austin Code Officer continues to prepare/modify the CommunityOutreachForm until it is approved by the Chain of Command. Once the CommunityOutreachForm is approved, the Austin Code Officer requests the Public Information Office Admin provide assistance with the case.  The Public Information Office Admin reviews the CommunityOutreachForm and determines if assistance services are approved.  If assistance services are approved, the Public Information Office Admin begins the Provide Assistance Services process.  The Public Information Office Admin communicates with the Austin Code Officer concerning the CommunityOutreachForm and any ServiceCases created for the responsible party. The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with notes on the assistance provided.
