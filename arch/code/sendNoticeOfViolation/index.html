<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer uses the Case Management System to look up case information to verify the Owner. The Austin Code Officer performs additional land history research using TCAD and other systems to verify property information. The Austin Code Officer uses the Case Management System to create a NoticeOfViolation. The Case Management System attaches the NoticeOfViolation to the CodeViolationCase. The Austin Code Officer reviews the NoticeOfViolation, and if approves, the Case Management System routes the NoticeOfViolation to the Austin Code Program Specialist. The Austin Code Program Specialist reviews and updates the NoticeOfViolation with the dateOfNotice (equals date sent in mail) and the CertifiedMailNumber. The Austin Code Program Specialist sends the NoticeOfViolation via regular mail and certified mail. The Austin Code Program Specialist scans and uploads the NoticeOfViolation to the Case Management System for the CodeViolationCase. If the NoticeOfViolation is returned or isn't received by the Owner and the CodeViolationCase is still active or in non-compliance, the Austin Code Officer posts the NoticeOfViolation at the property. The Austin Code Officer takes photographs of the posting and updates the Case Management System. Austin Code Officer may also hand deliver the NoticeOfViolation, which may not always be complete but photographs are always required. The Austin Code Program Specialist scans and uploads confirmation of returned or delivered NoticeOfViolation.
