<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Legal Coordinator creates the BSCAgenda for the Building and Standards Commission (BSC) meeting. The Austin Code Legal Coordinator emails the BSCAgenda to the City Clerk. At least 72 hours in advance of the BSC meeting, the BSCAgenda is uploaded to the City of Austin's website by the City Clerk. The Chain of Command sends Notification of prospective BSC cases to the relevant Austin Code Officers and their Chain of Command. Notification is typically sent the first business day of the month.
The Austin Code Legal Coordinator develops a BSCPresentation based on the BSCAgenda. Two weeks before the BSC meeting, the Austin Code Legal Coordinator conducts a pre-BSC meeting to review the cases with the Austin Code Officer and Chain of Command. Ten calendar days before the BSC meeting, the Austin Code Legal Coordinator sends Notification to the legally interested parties of the BSC cases (Owner, Tenant, etc.).
The BSC meets and evaluates the cases using the BSCPackets' information. The BSC determines whether to issue an Order, accept and modify an Order, or defer a ruling (to allow Property to come into compliance, future BSC review, additional information required, Property Owner unavailable, etc.). The BSC Meeting is recorded for future transcription of meeting minutes.
If the BSC accepts the recommendation for the case, or accepts with modification, the Austin Code Legal Coordinator creates an Order and has the BSC sign the Order. The LegalCase is updated in the Case Management System. The Legal Coordinator then sends an issued Order Notification to the County Clerk, City Clerk and Owner/Responsible Party.
The Austin Code Legal Coordinator uses a Contractor to transcribe the BSCMinutes from the BSCMeetingRecording. The BSCMinutes are uploaded to a network location and attached to the relevant LegalCases in the Case Management System.
The Owner/Responsible Party is provided a time period to comply with the Order. If the Owner doesn't display initiative to comply for a demolition Order, Austin Code begins the demolition process. The Austin Code Legal Coordinator requests Public Works coordinate a demolition bid with Contractors. The Legal Coordinator then notifies utilities to disconnect service and the demolition occurs. After the demolition, the Austin Code Officer performs an Inspection and updates the CodeViolationCase. The Pay Contractor and Bill Owner use case is invoked.
If the BSC defers their decision, then nothing occurs until the BSC reviews the case again.
The LegalCase is closed when the Property is in compliance and all penalties/fines are paid.

<td>If the violation concerns hazardous conditions, the Austin Code Officer applies Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The Austin Code Officer inspects the Property. The Austin Code Officer inspects from the exterior (initially from the right of way) to the interior (if the interior is accessible and permission has been granted by legally interested party or someone in Care/Control of Property). The Austin Code Officer takes photographs and measurements as needed (hot water temperature, air quality, interior temperature, light meter, ground-fault circuit interrupter, gas meter, carbon monoxide, smoke detector, fences, grass height, driveway and walkways, checks impervious cover, etc.). As needed, the Austin Code Officer performs research to identify the Property Owner, offense, ViolationType, OwnerInformation, and relevant PropertyInformation (GIS system, ARR Site, annexation information, AMANDA permit history, site plan, TCAD/WCAD for OwnerHistory and DeedHistory, CC&B, ZoningHistory, CodeOfOrdinances, etc.). The Austin Code Officer interviews relevant parties. For Waste Hauler Inspection: The Austin Code Officer makes contact with driver, visually inspects vehicle for decals on door, asks driver about awareness requirement for waste hauler license, ensures driver is operating within City of Austin (outside of city is exempt), double checks the Waste Hauler license, checks for safety-equipment violations, driver's license of driver, and takes photos of truck (including both doors and front license plate). If a short-term rental complaint, the Austin Code Officer responds more quickly than other complaints. On Fridays and Saturdays, the Austin Code Officer performs inspection during day, and from 6:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. On Sundays, inspections occur from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.</td>
