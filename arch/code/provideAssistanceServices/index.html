<p><b>Scope: </b>If a need is identified by the Austin Code Officer, the Public Information Office Admin assesses the Citizen's needs per the AssistanceResult (special needs, housing, food, mattresses and transportation). The Public Information Office Admin creates a ServiceCase and updates the CodeViolationCase with notes from the ServiceCase. The Public Information Office Admin contacts Health and Human Services for a service consultation.  Multiple departments are involved in the service consultation: Health and Human Services, Red Cross, HSEM, Capitol Metro and Capitol Food Bank. The Public Information Office Admin creates the HHSDAssessmentForm.  The Public Information Office Admin requests the Chain of Command approve the HHSDAssessmentForm.  The Chain of Command either approves the HHSDAssessmentForm or requests the Public Information Office Admin recreate the HHSDAssessmentForm. The Public Information Office Admin requests External Resources provide the services identified previously (ServiceCaseActionItem). Weekly reviews are conducted by the Public Information Office Admin for the RelocationCase with Chain of Command (PIO Supervisor, HHSD, etc.)  Review includes food needs, special needs, etc. If new services are required, the Public Information Office requests External Resources provide the services requested.  Reviews continue until the RelocationCase is closed. When services are no longer required, the Public Information Office Admin closes the ServiceCase.  The Public Information Office Admin updates the CodeViolationCase with notes on the ServiceCase.
