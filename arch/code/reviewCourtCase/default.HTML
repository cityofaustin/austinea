<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Legal Coordinator notifies Austin Code Officers of CourtCases on the Docket for the upcoming week. The Austin Code Legal Coordinator requests the Austin Code Officers perform Inspections on the Property. Afterwards, the Austin Code Legal Coordinator creates a Deferral for each CourtCase on the Docket. The Austin Code Legal Coordinator then uses the Case Management System to generate the Docket. The Austin Code Legal Coordinator provides legal case support to the Court including providing the Deferral, Inspection results, and necessary Permits. The Austin Code Legal Coordinator requests updates on the CourtCase from JEMS, if a Municipal CourtCase; or from a Legal Advisor, if a District CourtCase. The Austin Code Legal Coordinator updates the LegalCase in the Case Management System with the Court update. The CodeViolationCase is updated by the system. If the fine is paid by the Defendant, the Austin Code Legal Coordinator closes the LegalCase. LegalCases are only closed once the fine is paid.

<td>If the violation concerns hazardous conditions, the Austin Code Officer applies Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The Austin Code Officer inspects the Property. The Austin Code Officer inspects from the exterior (initially from the right of way) to the interior (if the interior is accessible and permission has been granted by legally interested party or someone in Care/Control of Property). The Austin Code Officer takes photographs and measurements as needed (hot water temperature, air quality, interior temperature, light meter, ground-fault circuit interrupter, gas meter, carbon monoxide, smoke detector, fences, grass height, driveway and walkways, checks impervious cover, etc.). As needed, the Austin Code Officer performs research to identify the Property Owner, offense, ViolationType, OwnerInformation, and relevant PropertyInformation (GIS system, ARR Site, annexation information, AMANDA permit history, site plan, TCAD/WCAD for OwnerHistory and DeedHistory, CC&B, ZoningHistory, CodeOfOrdinances, etc.). The Austin Code Officer interviews relevant parties. For Waste Hauler Inspection: The Austin Code Officer makes contact with driver, visually inspects vehicle for decals on door, asks driver about awareness requirement for waste hauler license, ensures driver is operating within City of Austin (outside of city is exempt), double checks the Waste Hauler license, checks for safety-equipment violations, driver's license of driver, and takes photos of truck (including both doors and front license plate). If a short-term rental complaint, the Austin Code Officer responds more quickly than other complaints. On Fridays and Saturdays, the Austin Code Officer performs inspection during day, and from 6:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. On Sundays, inspections occur from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.</td>
