<p><b>Scope: </b>The City Legal Department contacts the Austin Code Program Specialist to request a release of a Lien on a Property, if the Property was foreclosed. The City Legal Department provides a WarrantyDeed as proof of the foreclosure. If the Property is not foreclosed, a Responsible Party contacts the Austin Code Program Specialist and requests a PayoffStatement for the Lien. The Austin Code Program Specialist provides the PayoffStatement and the Responsible Party submits payment. The Process Payment use case is started once the payment arrives. After payment has been processed the Austin Code Program Specialist updates the CodeViolationCase in the Case Management System with notes on the payoff. The Austin Code Program Specialist also updates the Lien in the Case Management System, attaching the PayoffStatement and WarrantyDeed as appropriate. The Austin Code Program Specialist creates a ReleaseOfLien document and submits to the Chain of Command for approval. The Austin Code Program Specialist submits the ReleaseOfLien to the Chain of Command, and the Chain of Command signs the document. The Austin Code Program Specialist then creates an InterDepartmentPurchaseForm, and submits the InterDepartmentPurchaseForm to the Austin Code Admin Manager for approval. The Austin Code Admin Manager approves the InterDepartmentPurchaseForm and returns to the Austin Code Program Specialist. The Austin Code Program Specialist requests the Travis County Clerk release the Lien. After the Lien is released the Austin Code Program Specialist requests Austin Code Finance may Payment to the Travis County Clerk. The Austin Code Program Specialist updates the CodeViolationCase to indicate the Lien was released.
