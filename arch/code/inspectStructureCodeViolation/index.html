If a StructuralGas, the Austin Code Officer contacts the Gas service provider by phone to report the Violation.
If a StructureWater, the Austin Code Officer contacts the Water service provider by phone to report the Violation.
If an unsecured Violation, the Austin Code Officer begins the Board and Secure Premise use case.
