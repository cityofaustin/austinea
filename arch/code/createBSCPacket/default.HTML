<p><b>Scope: </b>An Austin Code Officer requests a Research Analyst creates maps of a Property for a Building Standards Commission case. The Austin Code Officer assembles a BSCPacket. The Austin Code Officer also creates a LegalCase in the Case Management System. The BSCPacket requires multiple levels of approval from the Chain of Command. The Austin Code Officer submits the BSCPacket to the Chain of Command (the Austin Code Officer’s direct manager/supervisor) for review. The Chain of Command reviews the BSCPacket and returns to the Austin Code Officer. If any changes were identified during the Chain of Command Review the Chain of Command requests the Austin Code Officer modify the BSCPacket. The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase in the Case Management System after the review. The Austin Code Officer then submits the BSCPacket to the Chain of Command (Assistant Division Manager) for review. The Chain of Command reviews the BSCPacket. If any changes were identified during the Chain of Command Review the Chain of Command requests the Austin Code Officer modify the BSCPacket. The Chain of Command requests the Austin Code Legal Officer review the BSCPacket (typically completed within 72 hours of request). The Austin Code Legal Officer completes their review, and if changes are necessary, requests the Austin Code Officer modify the BSCPacket. The Austin Code Legal Officer then coordinates a BSC case review. The Austin Code Officer, Investigator, Assistant Division Manager, and Austin Code Legal Coordinator meet to discuss the BSCPacket contents in relation to the upcoming BSCCase.
