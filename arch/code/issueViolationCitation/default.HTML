<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer writes a citation, which requires a good form of ID. The Austin Code Officer provides a copy of the citation to the violator. If Austin Policy Department (APD) assistance is required to complete the citation, the Austin Code Officer requests an APD Officer's assistance. The Austin Code Officer takes photographs of what the violation citation was created for-one citation is generated per violation. The Austin Code Officer updates the Case Management System with citation information. The citation is scanned and uploaded into the Case Management System (sometimes by the Austin Code Officer, other times by Admin). Citations are attached to the relevant CodeViolationCase; if no case exists when citation is created, the Austin Code Officer creates a CodeViolationCase before uploading the citation. After the citation is created in the Case Management System, refer to the Initiate Court Action use case.
