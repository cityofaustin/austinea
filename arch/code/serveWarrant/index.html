<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer requests a Notary to notarize an Affidavit to complete a SearchWarrant. After the Affidavit has been notarized, the Austin Code Officer submits the SearchWarrrant, with Affidavit attached, to a Court Judge (either Municipal Court or District Court Judge) for approval. The Court Judge reviews the SearchWarrant and determines whether to sign the SearchWarrant and make it active, or not sign it. The Court Judge returns the SearchWarrant with their decision. If the SearchWarrant is signed by the Court Judge, the Austin Code Officer requests an APD District Representative serve the SearchWarrant. The APD District Representative serves the SearchWarrant within three calendar days. If the SearchWarrant is not served within three calendar days, it is no longer active and must be resubmitted to the Court Judge for approval. If the SearchWarrant is served, the Austin Code Officer performs an Inspection, and creates an InventoryList during the Inspection. The InventoryList and SearchWarrant are returned to the Court. Afterwards, the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase in the Case Management System with the SearchWarrant, InventoryList, Inspection results, and their notes.

<td>If the violation concerns hazardous conditions, the Austin Code Officer applies Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The Austin Code Officer inspects the Property. The Austin Code Officer inspects from the exterior (initially from the right of way) to the interior (if the interior is accessible and permission has been granted by legally interested party or someone in Care/Control of Property). The Austin Code Officer takes photographs and measurements as needed (hot water temperature, air quality, interior temperature, light meter, ground-fault circuit interrupter, gas meter, carbon monoxide, smoke detector, fences, grass height, driveway and walkways, checks impervious cover, etc.). As needed, the Austin Code Officer performs research to identify the Property Owner, offense, ViolationType, OwnerInformation, and relevant PropertyInformation (GIS system, ARR Site, annexation information, AMANDA permit history, site plan, TCAD/WCAD for OwnerHistory and DeedHistory, CC&B, ZoningHistory, CodeOfOrdinances, etc.). The Austin Code Officer interviews relevant parties. For Waste Hauler Inspection: The Austin Code Officer makes contact with driver, visually inspects vehicle for decals on door, asks driver about awareness requirement for waste hauler license, ensures driver is operating within City of Austin (outside of city is exempt), double checks the Waste Hauler license, checks for safety-equipment violations, driver's license of driver, and takes photos of truck (including both doors and front license plate). If a short-term rental complaint, the Austin Code Officer responds more quickly than other complaints. On Fridays and Saturdays, the Austin Code Officer performs inspection during day, and from 6:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. On Sundays, inspections occur from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.</td>
