<p><b>Scope: </b>The Responsible Party contacts the Austin Code Officer to request an Extension. Extensions must be requested in writing (plan to resolve) before ViolationResolutionTime is passed. Alternatively, an Extension is requested in person to an Austin Code Officer. If requested in person the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with the plan to resolve, days needed. The Austin Code Officer reviews the the extension request and determines whether to approve or disapprove the request. If extension is over 30 days, or CodeViolationCase age exceeds 90 days then Chain of Command must approve extension. If approved, the Austin Code Officer documents in the CodeViolationCase: Extension requested, comply by date is updated, notes, attach written request. The Austin Code Officer notifies the Responsible Party of the extension decision.
