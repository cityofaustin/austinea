<p><b>Scope: </b>The Austin Code Officer creates a DiagramOfWorkRequired using the CodeViolationCase's information (Property). The Austin Code Officer requests the Contractor boards and secures the premise. The Contractor returns a BoardAndSecureBill to Austin Code. The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with the DiagramOfWorkRequired. After the Property has been boarded and secured, the Austin Code Officer inspects the property--typically within 24 hours from the board and secure.

<tr>
<td>The user updates the CodeViolationCase with relevant information to the case. If the CodeViolationCase generated a StopWorkOrder, the StopWorkOrder is attached to the CodeViolationCase.
The user attaches a copy of the DiagramOfWorkRequired. If a board and secure occurs, a BoardAndSecureBill is attached to the CodeViolationCase by Austin Code Admin. If a sign was removed, the Austin Code Officer adds the sign and information to the CodeViolationCase. Additionally, if CautionBarriers were placed, information on the CautionBarriers is added to the CodeViolationCase. If property information was updated, the Case Management System includes updated property information.
The user updates the CodeViolationCase with information relevant to the change. This includes, but is not limited to, BoardAndSecureBill, PropertyAbatementBill, FollowUpNotes, photographs (boarded, non-boarded, posted notifications, placards), emails, PhoneCallSummary, other relevant information and inter-department communications. If a ServiceCase is created, the Public Information Office Admin adds notes to the CodeViolationCase including the CitizenNeed and ServicesRecommended for ServiceCase. If CorrectiveResources are identified, the user updates the CodeViolationCase with a list of CorrectiveResources provided (three resources) and notes of contact with Owner/Tenant. HardshipReason is added to the CodeViolationCase.
If new violations are identified, the user adds the new violation to the Case Management System and the violation is attached to the original CodeComplaintCase. If a TitleSearch is completed, the TitleSearch is added to the CodeViolationCase. If additional LegallyInterestedParties are identified, the parties are added to the CodeViolationCase. If a NoticeOfViolation is generated, the NoticeOfViolation is added to the CodeViolationCase. If posted at the property, photographs are attached to the CodeViolationCase. If the NoticeOfViolation is delivered and a certified mail receipt is received, the receipt is added to the CodeViolationCase.
If a citation is created, the Case Management System attaches the citation to the CodeViolationCase. Additionally, the user scans and uploads a copy of the physical citation to the Case Management System. If an AdministrativeHearingWarning is issued, the user updates the CodeViolationCase with information on the issued AdministrativeHearingWarning.
If an AdministrativeHearingCitation is issued, the user updates the CodeViolationCase with the AdministrativeHearingCitation, and a LegalCase is created. The user scans and uploads returned liens to the CodeViolationCase. If a lien is filed for the property, the TRVNumber is added to the CodeViolationCase.
The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeViolationCase with information concerning Violation extensions, written request, reason for approval/denial, etc.
