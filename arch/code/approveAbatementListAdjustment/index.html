<p><b>Scope: </b>The Property Abator requests the Austin Code Officer request a WorkRequiredList adjustment. If the requested change causes the WorkRequiredList to exceed $1000 the Austin Code Officer requests the Chain of Command evaluate the WorkRequiredList's change and approve. The Austin Code Officer then notifies the Property Abator of the modified WorkRequiredList. Abatement is halted until the Chain of Command approves the WorkRequiredList. After an Invoice has been received the Austin Code Officer updates the WorkRequiredList with the Invoice details, and then accesses the Case Management System to update the CodeViolationCase.
