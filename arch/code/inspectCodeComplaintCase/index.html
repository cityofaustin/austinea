<p><b>Scope: </b>Daily, the Austin Code Officer queries the Case Management System for their ToDoQueue identifying CodeCases they need to inspect. The Case Management System returns CodeCases including CodeComplaintCases. The Austin Code Officer develops an InspectionRoute using primarily online services. Alternatively, the Austin Code Officer uses the Case Management System to create the InspectionRoute. If the CodeComplaintCase contains Complainant information, the Austin Code Officer contacts the Complainant and updates the CodeComplaintCase. The Austin Code Officer performs an initial Inspection of the Property.
If no Violations are found, the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeComplaintCase with their findings and then closes the CodeComplaintCase in the Case Management System. The Austin Code Officer contacts the Complainant to relay their findings, and the Inspect Code Complaint use case ends. If the Austin Code Officer is unable to contact the Owner or Tenant, the Austin Code Officer leaves a DoorHanger and takes photographs as proof the DoorHanger was left. If contact with internal or external government entities is required, the Austin Code Officer contacts the appropriate groups. Contact may be to inform group, request information, or research.
The Austin Code Officer updates the CodeComplaintCase with notes on the work completed. The Austin Code Officer then determines if Complainant assistance is required to validate the case. The Austin Code Officer attempts to contact the Complainant for additional information. If the Complainant provides extra information, the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeComplaintCase. The Austin Code Officer attempts to contact the Complainant multiple times based on the severity of the issue reported. If the complaint can't be substantiated by the Complainant, the Austin Code Officer updates the CodeComplaintCase and closes the case. The Austin Code Officer performs additional Inspections until the case is substantiated. As part of the subsequent Inspections, the Austin Code Officer verifies PropertyInformation, performs Property land history research, inspects the Property, and then updates the CodeComplaintCase.

<td>If the violation concerns hazardous conditions, the Austin Code Officer applies Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The Austin Code Officer inspects the Property. The Austin Code Officer inspects from the exterior (initially from the right of way) to the interior (if the interior is accessible and permission has been granted by legally interested party or someone in Care/Control of Property). The Austin Code Officer takes photographs and measurements as needed (hot water temperature, air quality, interior temperature, light meter, ground-fault circuit interrupter, gas meter, carbon monoxide, smoke detector, fences, grass height, driveway and walkways, checks impervious cover, etc.). As needed, the Austin Code Officer performs research to identify the Property Owner, offense, ViolationType, OwnerInformation, and relevant PropertyInformation (GIS system, ARR Site, annexation information, AMANDA permit history, site plan, TCAD/WCAD for OwnerHistory and DeedHistory, CC&B, ZoningHistory, CodeOfOrdinances, etc.). The Austin Code Officer interviews relevant parties. For Waste Hauler Inspection: The Austin Code Officer makes contact with driver, visually inspects vehicle for decals on door, asks driver about awareness requirement for waste hauler license, ensures driver is operating within City of Austin (outside of city is exempt), double checks the Waste Hauler license, checks for safety-equipment violations, driver's license of driver, and takes photos of truck (including both doors and front license plate). If a short-term rental complaint, the Austin Code Officer responds more quickly than other complaints. On Fridays and Saturdays, the Austin Code Officer performs inspection during day, ands from 6:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. On Sundays, inspections occur from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.</td>
