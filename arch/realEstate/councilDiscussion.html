<p><span style='color:black; font-weight: bold;'>Directions from and promises to Council – AFC, Item #3, 4/24/13</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>7 minute mark, MPT Cole/Lauraine: <span
style='background:yellow'>Transmit information on acquisitions and donations
manually to FSD</span></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>8m, CM Spelman/Lauraine: <span
style='background:yellow'>Look for previous missing items from FSD database</span></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Exchange at 10m:</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>CM Spelman:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> It seems we’d be more certain if we had one comprehensive
database, which we could watch, we’d appear to know everything that’s going on.
<span style='background:yellow'>You’d be the logical people to ensure that it’s
a complete database</span>. Everybody else could link to it to make sure we’ve
got everything. Correct?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>And as the audit suggested, we’re going to have all the
stakeholders together so that we’ve got a format that everyone can draw from.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>So there will be one database, it will be yours, everybody will
be pulling it out?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>Yes sir.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> And you’re going to be working with AE for them to buy
real estate through you guys, or at least let you know what they’ve been
buying?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> <span style='background:yellow'>Step 1 is to get a list of
their inventory, so quickly we can get a comprehensive list. That’s step 1.</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> Why does AE buy their real estate separately from you?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>That has been done since I can remember, since the 80s. It
was before I got here.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>It’s always been this way, nobody remembers why. I
understand. I’ll have to ask somebody from AE about it. Fortuitously, someone
who happens to know someone about this –</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>(Elaine Hart)</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>EH: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>I believe that they’ve had their own Real estate division
because of the kinds of right of way acquisition they do, for their
transmission lines. Those kinds of things, and the volume of that work, and the
specialty of that. They have, for years, had a separate real estate division,
primarily for acquiring those right-of-ways so they can have transmission
lines, that sort of thing, and they do have substation land acquisitions as
well.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>So the issue from AE’s point of view is that there’s just a
higher volume than there is for the rest of the City. Probably most of the
transactions for the City are AE transactions?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>I wouldn’t say that.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>EH: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>That I wouldn’t be able to respond to. But I don’t think
it’s a lot of buildings, it’s more to do with the nature of the electric
business, and acquiring property that you can build electric lines on, as well
as your substations. There’s not a lot of building acquisition that has been
conducted by AE. In fact, in the 80s, the Town Lake Center building was
acquired by Financial Services and City Legal.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>On the other hand, ORES buys easements, ROW, parkland, and
buildings as well. So you all do the same stuff that AE does, you just do it
separately, in parallel.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> Yes, that’s correct.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> <span style='background:yellow'>Are you going to be
talking to AE, is it on the table that perhaps we don’t need to have two
separate real estate departments?</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black;background:yellow'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>We haven’t breached that topic, but we
could.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black;background:yellow'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>If you could consider it, I would like
that.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> Ok.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>It seems to me you’re working in parallel, you’re doing
conceptually similar stuff, there may be a high volume in AE, but there’s an
awfully high volume in the rest of the City, and nobody can tell who’s got the
most volume. <span style='background:yellow'>We may as well at least talk about
it. Especially since it’s been this way for as long as anybody can remember,
Maybe we ought to think about whether it needs to continue to be this way.</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>Yes sir.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> Thank you ma’am.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>One last question... What’s your timetable for having the
glitch fixed and having one database that everybody else can tie into? Do you
have a sense of how long it’s going to take?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>We’re shooting for January to have a comprehensive
database, and then also have it tested, to make sure it’s a comprehensive
database. We’ve identified several steps, getting the groups together, getting
the data, putting it in one location, and going back and testing it, does it
really contain all the data.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> I presume we’ll see some third-party contract to help us
work through the database, or are we going to do it in-house?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> I’ll know better <span style='background:yellow'>after we
have the meeting after all the stakeholders, and see what kind of databases
they’re using. If we’re all using databases that are incompatible, it will
probably take a third party.</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>But if we’re using stuff that you can output in a
particular format, then it’s easier.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>Right, yes sir.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> <span style='background:yellow'>If you can let us know
when you’ve got a better expected time of arrival, I’d like to hear about it.</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> Yes sir, I sure will.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>S: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>Thank you, ma’am.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>16m, CM Morrison: <span
style='background:yellow'>Comparison of ORES database with WCAD and TCAD</span></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Exchange at 17m:</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>CM Morrison: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>If we could get an interim report, not only
as CM Spelman reported, but once you’re able to go through some of this review
process, to see if there’s -- I guess I’ll keep my fingers crossed, if there’s
some beautiful piece of property out there that we own, that nobody has their
fingers on, right in the middle of an area where we really need parks.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>CM Tovo: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>I hope so.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>M: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>So if you can give us a report on not
only what you find after that analysis, but also after you’ve figured out how
you’re going to go about merging all these databases. I think that would be
really helpful, interesting information.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> I will do that.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>M:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> A couple of other comments. I think that the issue of AE
having their own real estate process versus the centralized one is something
that we’ve sort of been discussing. <span style='background:yellow'>The question
is, where does it make sense to have centralized services vs. distributed
services. Especially with regard to AE, it would be interesting to get the
analysis that you all come up with on that.</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>Ok.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>M: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>And lastly I wanted to mention, you were here in this room
for our CPTC meeting recently, talking about the work that’s going on in
response to a resolution that Council did, talking about real estate, it’s
really about real estate disposition. And one of the suggestions you made,
although you’re going to be doing more work on it, was to have a City-wide,
system-wide departmental assessment every year, about what property might be
surplus, and what we would go about doing with that property, once it’s
identified on an annual basis. Do you see that effort playing into this effort
in any way? <span style='background:yellow'>I know that one of the issues on
the table that came up there was having a comprehensive database.</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black;background:yellow'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>I certainly do. I think that once we
discover all the properties out there, I mean there may be land that departments
don’t know they own, that they may want to designate as surplus. I definitely
see that it could play a role in that.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black;background:yellow'>M: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>Yes, I think this is great. It seems like
the two efforts are really aligning, and are going to be leveraging each other.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Ken Mory:</span></b><span
style='color:black'> May I? I just want to make it clear that it’s not just AE,
there are other enterprise departments that have their own databases and do
their own purchasing, and I think you all were going to address that as well.
My other question was, if you all want feedback, when would you like that
feedback, when would you like to have that interim report, is there a time
frame?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>M: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>I guess it would depend<span style='background:yellow'>. I
see the estimate for completing the comprehensive database is January 2014. I
would imagine you would have to have a plan in place for making that happen.
What would you estimate when the plan would be ready? I think that would be a
good time for the report, whenever the plan is ready. When would you say,
September? October?</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black;background:yellow'>LR: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>I think that would be a good time frame,
yes.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:black;background:yellow'>M: </span></b><span
style='color:black;background:yellow'>And then that will give you three months
to actually get the database actually implemented, once you figure out the
approach. So maybe end of September.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>21m, CM Morrison: <span
style='background:yellow'>I see that one of the systems is going to be MS
Excel, and ensuring the fidelity of data through MS Excel is much less
successful or guaranteed than in a real database. So I think it would be a real
improvement if we could have all our data in a secure place.</span> </span></p>
