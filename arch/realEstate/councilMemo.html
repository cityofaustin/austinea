<p>The City's Enterprise Architecture (EA) Office, in coordination with the Real Estate Services Office, is undergoing a concerted effort to collect the operational requirements to develop a Citywide Real Estate Inventory System (REIS) per City Council guidance and <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Auditor/au12125.pdf">City Auditor recommendation</a>. To communicate REIS scope, the Real Estate Services Office staff developed and coordinated the following vision and mission statements:

<p><b><u>Vision:</u></b><br />
<i>Comprehensive knowledge of all City owned real property and easements to include relevant details for any given property, to include status, location, staff location, maintenance information, environmental considerations, covenants, use restrictions, leasing, etc. implemented using a well-managed information technology strategy.</i></p>
<p><b><u>Mission:</u></b><br />
<i>Develop and evolve integrated real estate information sources, identify relevant roles and responsibilities and department operational needs under the guidance and approval of relevant city leadership.</i></p>

<p>The purpose of REIS includes, but is not limited to, the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lease and Manage City Properties</li>
<li>Procure Leases</li>
<li>Sell City Owned Properties</li>
<li>Acquire Fee Simple Tracts and Easements</li>
<li>Manage and Coordinate Eminent Domain Cases</li>
<li>Process Street/Right of Way Vacations and Easement Releases</li>
<li>Manage Property Assets</li>
<li>Process Parkland Dedication and Donations</li>
</ul>

<p>The table below identifies known city real estate information sources. The City's Enterprise Architecture Office is working closely with each POC to develop department specific operational need specifications and a citywide logical data model for REIS - this activity is essential to ensure REIS satisfies departmental needs. During this activity, EA may be required to document department processes in order to understand the information in context of operational use and to identify important interfaces to inter-department or outside information sources.</p>

<p>Through EA analysis, we determined that REIS is not as simple as consolidating real estate information into a single database. As shown on the table above, City-owned real estate information is used by various department roles throughout the City. Therefore, an operational analysis is required to ensure REIS provides the relevant data attributes to enable various department purpose and value. City departments maintain real estate information differently because the purpose varies significantly between them. As a result, each department developed their own database to suit their needs.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that databases that don't provide useful purpose relevant to the desired outcome (i.e., reports, search elements, attribute stored values, etc.) are not used and duplicative databases are created and maintained leading to data concordance (differences between the data sources) - eventually leading to inaccurate information. This is likely the situation which has led to the city's current state. Furthermore, real estate attribute values must synchronize with unavoidable outside sources such as county deed management systems. Enterprise Architecture, therefore, is addressing these issues.</p>

<p>Through operational analysis, EA is examining each department data source (i.e., Excel spreadsheets, MS Access databases, flat-files, outside sources, etc.) and evaluating the information's purpose and use. Using these sources, EA is creating a Citywide logical data model to be used as a requirements baseline to eliminate data concordance for final development by a selected vendor. There are other benefits to this approach as well.</p>

<p>The operational need specifications and logical data model provide a requirements baseline to write the statement of work (SOW) scope, which substantially reduces vendor risk and overall cost to the city. Also, because EA is performing the operational analysis, the city does not incur additional costs for a vendor provided analysis and solution design.</p>

<p>The following table represents anticipated tasks and dates to develop a citywide Real Estate Information System.</p>

</table>
</div>

<p>In addition to the proposed acquisition activities, city leadership must reevaluate current real estate information ownership policy and procedures. Database access controls must be evaluated and established to include Service Level Agreement (SLA) with Communications and Technology Management (CTM) to ensure effective performance, service maintenance, information protection and disaster recovery.</p>

<p>We estimate an initial startup cost for REIS at ~$192K with an annual operating cost of $12K per year. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
