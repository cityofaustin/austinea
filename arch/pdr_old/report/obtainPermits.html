<tr><th>Category/Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />setupRequiredPermits</td>
<td>Although permits were initially identified and setup by Perform Regulatory Review, the system provides the ability for Submittal Coordinators to review and determine additional permit requirements or required changes. The system provides the ability for the Submittal Coordinator to adjust permit requirements for any Submittal Package. The system provides the ability to administer various states of permits such as overriding normal day-to-day transactions such as suspension or revocation of permit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Authorized Permit Person/<br />reviewNotification</td>
<td>The system provides Notification via text message or email when permits are ready for issuance. Notification may also include other indications of permit status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />associateSubmittalPackages</td>
<td>The system provides the ability to associate Submittal Packages. For example, a building permit application may require completion of a land use re-zoning case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />issueSinglePurposePermit</td>
<td>The Authorized Permit Person selects the desired trade permit (or mobile home building permit) for the system to issue. This function is limited to only the alternate flow to [request a permit] or [reactivate expired permit] and designated for selected trade contractors performing routine day-to-day activities requiring permits. When a mobile home is involved (only in mobile home parks), this requires issuance of a building permit to associate relevant trade permits to the project. This type of building permit can be issued as a single purpose permit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />obtainPermit</td>
<td>During the final review and approval of a Submittal Package, the Review Notification provides an encoded link (URL) that directs the Authorized Permit Person to the associated Project Information and location to obtain required permits - the system provides a list of available permit requests. When a particular permit is selected, the link directs the Authorized Permit Person to the proper URL where the system looks up relevant permit information, status and provides various permit options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />lookUpPermitStatus</td>
<td>The system looks up the Project Information encoded from the obtainPermit URL and presents the Authorized Permit Person with options to submit for selected permits previously identified during the Perform Regulatory Review process and/or updated by the Submittal Coordinator. The Authorized Permit Person is provided options based on available permits and their status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />selectPermitOption</td>
<td>The Permit Applicant selects from the permitting options available depending on the Permit Status of the project. The applicant may request a permit, transfer a building permit, cancel a trade permit, reactivate expired permit, request extension, and withdraw permit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />determinePermitApplication</td>
<td>Based on the Permit Applicant selection to request permit, the system provides the appropriate permit application form for the Permit Applicant to compete and submit. Permit Applicant attribute values known by the system automatically populate relevant values on the form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />completePermitApplication</td>
<td>The Authorized Permit Person uses the system to complete the permit application. Known values of the system automatically populate relevant attributes of the form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />determineRemittance</td>
<td>Based on the permit selected, the system automatically determines the Remittance required and presents the Remittance information to the Submittal Applicant with indication of selected form of payment (i.e., credit card, ACH, etc.). The Remittance amounts must be modifiable by identified city staff and not hard coded into the system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />addToRemittanceQueue</td>
<td>The Authorized Permit Person uses the system to process multiple permit requests (if needed). The system adds remittance to a Remittance Queue until completing permit requests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />payRemittance</td>
<td>Using traditional online Electronic Financial Services approved by the city, the Authorized Permit Person pays the required Remittance and receives Acknowledgment of payment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Electronic Financial Service/<br />processRemittance</td>
<td>The system provides an interface to city approved financial vendor to process online electronic transactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />addToReviewQueue</td>
<td>The system provides a modifiable rules engine that places certain permit requests into a review queue for Reviewer to ensure completeness and relevance to the request. Common trade permits by established contractors may not require review, but the rules engine may require some trade permit requests to be reviewed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />reviewPermitApplication</td>
<td>The Reviewer selects the Permit Application from the Review Queue and reviews for completeness and accuracy. If approved, the Permit Applicant is provided a URL encoded link to select to acknowledge inspection responsibility and permit issuance. If declined, the Notification provides indication of the deficiencies of the Permit Application and provides a URL encoded with information to redirect the Permit Applicant to the application to correct and resubmit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Authorized Permit Person/<br />reviewNotification</td>
<td>The system provides Notification via text message or email when permits are ready for issuance. Notification may also include other indications of permit status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />acknowledgeInspectionResponsibility</td>
<td>Once a permit is prepared by the system, the system indicates to the Permit Applicant responsibility for proper inspection and provides selected indication that this responsibility is accepted in the form of an Acknowledgment before a printable permit is issued by the system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />issuePermit</td>
<td>When the system receives the proper Acknowledgment of inspection responsibility, the system prepares the selected permit in a printable form (i.e., PDF, etc.).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />transferBuildingPermit</td>
<td>The system provides an Authorized Permit Applicant the ability to transfer a building permit to a prescribed contractor. The Authorize Permit Applicant enters relevant information into the system that clearly identifies the contractor receiving the transferred building permit and stores it into the system.

If an inspection already occurred at the time of cancellation, there is no refund of Remittance; otherwise, a percentage of the Remittance is returned to Electronic Financial Service account. If a refund is issued, a new contractor must pay 100% of the required Remittance. If no refund issued, the contractor must pay 50% of the required Remittance to reissue the permit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />determineExpiredPermits</td>
<td>The system determines the relevant expired permit(s) associated with the Submittal Package Project Information and presents to the Authorized Permit Person for selection to reactivate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />reactivateExpiredPermit</td>
<td>The Permit Applicant uses the system to reactivate an expired permit. This requires a form to enter pertinent information (such as reason for reactivation) prior to reactivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issue Permit/<br />determinePermitFee</td>
<td>Based on the selected permit requested to be reactivated, the system determines the necessary permit fee.</td>
</tr>
