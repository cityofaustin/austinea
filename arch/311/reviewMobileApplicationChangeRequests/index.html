<p><b>Scope: </b>The Mobile App Lead queries for new, or review pending, MobileAppChangeRequests each week and prepares a MobileAppReviewAgenda for the Chain of Command. The Chain of Command reviews the MobileAppChangeRequests along with the MobileAppGuidelines and ServiceRequestDocumentation to determine how to proceed with the MobileAppChangeRequest. The Chain of Command defers the decision short-term, requires additional information, approves the request, denies the request, or defers the decision long-term. If the decision is deferred short-term the Chain of Command reviews the MobileAppChangeRequest at the next meeting. If more information is required the Chain of Command requests the Business Process Specialist gather more information. The Business Process Specialist meets with the Client Department and gathers extra information. The Business Process Specialist notifies the Mobile App Lead with the new information. If the request is denied the Business Process Specialist sends a denial Notification to the Client Department. If the request is approved the Business Process Specialist sends an approval Notification to the Client Department. If the request is deferred long-term (deferral to next update cycle) the Business Process Specialist sends a deferral Notification to the Client Department. The Mobile App Lead updates the MobileAppChangeRequests with the decision by the Chain of Command, actions taken by the Business Process Specialist, and any new information. If the Chain of Command deferred the request, or required more information, the MobileAppChangeRequest enters a review pending status for review later. If the MobileAppRequest was denied the MobileAppChangeRequest is closed. If approved, the MobileAppChangeRequest moves on to the requirements gathering phase. The review process recurs weekly until 60 calendar days before the last negotiated MobileAppGoLiveDate. Once less than 60 calendar days remain till MobileAppGoLiveDate the review process ends and any new MobileAppRequests will automatically be deferred to the next update cycle. If the MobileAppRequest is for a mobile application enhancement, not ServiceRequestType related, requirements gathering with the Client Department is not required.
