<p><b>Scope: </b>The system provides multiple ways for a ServiceRequest to be created:
<br>
<br>If a CRM User submits a request:
<li>The system displays related information to the CRM User based on information provided during text entry fields. 
<li>The system returns KnowledgeBaseItems if a Knowledge Base search is submitted. 
<li>If bulk upload the CRM User submits a request to create or update ServiceRequests in bulk and includes an Attachment identifying the relevant ServiceRequest information. The system determines if the Attachment row contains a new ServiceRequest or an update to a ServiceRequest. The system loops until all rows in the Attachment have been completed. 
<li>If mass entry, the CRM User requests the system creates a MassEntryServiceRequest, which is a specialized version of an existing ServiceRequestType already in the system. The system creates the ServiceRequest and then prompts the user for a new MassEntryServiceRequest. The CRM User has the option to keep existing information from the previous MassEntryServiceRequest for reuse, or modifies the information as needed to specify a different ServiceRequest. The CRM User specifies whether the MassEntryServiceRequests are for future work or previous work completed.
<br>
<br>If the request is submitted via a Website: 
<li>A Citizen requests the Website creates a WebServiceRequest. The Website, in turn, requests the system to create a ServiceRequest.
<br>
<br>If the request is submitted via a Mobile Application:
<li>A Citizen requests the Mobile Application creates a MobileApplicationServiceRequest. The Mobile Application, in turn, requests the system to create a ServiceRequest.
<br>
<br>If the request is submitted via an Interface:
<li>The Interface requests the system creates a ServiceRequest.
<br>
<br>If the request is submitted via Social Media or SMS:
<li>A Citizen requests Social Media to create a SocialMediaSMSServiceRequest. The system requests the Social Media platform for any SocialMediaSMSServiceRequests. Alternatively, a Citizen can request a SocialMediaSMSServiceRequest be created through SMS directly to the system. The system responds to the Citizen, if SMS, or the Social Media platform requesting additional information to complete the SocialMediaSMSServiceRequest. The Citizen responds with additional information until the system has enough information to determine the ServiceRequest can be created. At any point during communication with the system the Citizen may request a cancellation of the SocialMediaSMSServiceRequest. Once all information has been gathered, and the Citizen hasn’t cancelled the request the system creates a ServiceRequest. If Social Media was used to initiate the request the system requests the Social Media platform to post an update on the request (ServiceRequestNumber, etc.).
<br>
<br>If the request is submitted via email:
<li>The Citizen sends an email to the system. The system creates a ServiceRequest based on the email contents and address.
<lu>
<br>
<br>If a Location is provided at any time during the ServiceRequest creation the system performs the Lookup GIS Information use case.

<td>A CRM User accesses the system and requests the system creates a ServiceRequest. The system provides multiple ServiceRequestTypes to choose from, pre-configured by a CRM Manager. The system requests a Location, if required, and validates the Location against configured GISLayers (validate against GISLayers, street address or intersection required). The system performs GIS lookup, and general lookup for relevant information (nearby places, resources, schools, parks, alerts, other ServiceRequests, GIS information, KnowledgeBase items, etc.). The system provides Questions of various types, configured by CRM Manager, and prompts the user with Alerts (triggered by Question answers or selection of ServiceRequestType) to alter the ServiceRequest business flow as necessary. The system provides the ability to add, remove, Questions based on previous answers, and alter the business flow based on Question answers. The user is able to attach files to the ServiceRequest. The system sends messages (pages, emails, etc.) based on Question answers to configurable recipients. The system assigns a Priority and Status to the ServiceRequest based on the configured options by the CRM Manager. The system generates a ServiceRequestNumber (unique tracking number for the individual request) once the ServiceRequest is saved. The system allows the CRM user to capture Participant information (name, phone number, location, email, Questions, etc.). The system provides a field to enter general comments/details as needed. Additionally, the system allows users to perform a bulk ServiceRequest creation. The system completes any ServiceRequest configuration for the bulk created ServiceRequests similar to singularly created ServiceRequests. The system provides a mass entry intake option that presents specialized ServiceRequests. MassEntryServiceRequests are created in a user defined status, typically Closed. If the MassEntryServiceRequest is created in a Closed Status the system doeesn't create Activities for the work group to complete as the work was completed previously. The system provides a Website intake for ServiceRequests along with WebsiteServiceRequests that map back to a ServiceRequest in the system. The system provides a Mobile Application intake for ServiceRequests along with MobileApplicationServiceRequests that map back to a ServiceRequest in the system. The system provides the capability for an external system to interface with it. The system interfacing provides the InterfaceServiceRequest information and the system maps the InterfaceServiceRequest back to a ServiceRequest in the system. CRM Users create attachments to other data points in CRM including (ServiceRequests, Locations, GISInformation, etc.).</td>

<td>The system updates a ServiceRequest per the requested update. If the ServiceRequest is configured with auto-assignment rules for CRM Users the system assigns the ServiceRequest Activities to resources based on Questions/Answers, Location, GISLayer, Time of Day, Shift, Route, Zone, etc. encompassing business process rules for group. CRM Users update the ServiceRequest, and if interfaced with an external system, may request an update be sent to the interface. If an Interface updates the ServiceRequest the Interface transmits an update Notification to the system and includes the information to update/append, etc. Interface updates any portion of the ServiceRequest required to complete ServiceRequest (Status, Questions/Answers, Activities, etc.). ServiceRequest Activities are assignable to multiple Resources/CRMUsers and Activities track Resource usage. The ServiceRequest is configured to require specific be completed by a user before it may be saved (answering a question, completing an activity, etc.). ServiceRequest updates are completed by CRM Users and any portion of the ServiceRequest may be updated by the CRM User per their Access Permissions. As CRM Users check in at Locations the system updates Activities with arrival date/time, Location (GPS coordinates). Activities allow CRM Users to estimate completion duration and actual completion duration. CRM Users can attach relevant information to the ServiceRequest including (pointers to other ServiceRequests, Locations, GISData, etc.). When the ServiceRequest work is completed the ServiceRequest status is changed to a Closed status.</td>
