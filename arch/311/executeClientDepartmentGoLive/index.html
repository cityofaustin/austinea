<p><b>Scope: </b>After all services have been completed, the Client Management Team creates a ServiceLevelAgreement, or updates the ServiceLevelAgreement if one already exists for the Client Department. The Client Management Team meets with the CLient Department to review the ServiceLevelAgreement, services completed (ServiceRequestType, Website, ReferenceMaterial, etc.), and identify a go live date. After the go live date is identified the Client Management Team sends Notification of the go live date. The Client Management Team requests the 311 Command Center notify 311 staff of the go live date. The Client Management Team coordinates the go live by monitoring ServiceRequests, running Reports, and meeting with the Client Department. During the first 24-hours the Client Management Team monitors the Client Department exclusively, and monitors the Client Department for 2 weeks afterwards. After the go live the Client Management Team conducts lessons learned meetings internally with 311 staff and externally with the Client Department. If Feedback is identified during the lessons learned meetings the Create Feedback Request and Triage use case is started. Finally, if the Client Department is new, or adding a new service, the Client Management Team meets with the Client Department to transition the Client Department to an operational mode. The ClientProject is completed.
