<p><b>Scope: </b>A TrainingCase is created by Document Approver (Process Supervisor) when training is identified for a QMSProcess/Document change. TrainingCases are sent to Trainees. Each Trainee must be trained on the ISOProcess change (Process or Document). The Trainee acknowledges the TrainingCase (read and understood the training, need more training, or does not apply to job), date/time captured. 
If the Trainee needs more training the Process Supervisor is notified the Trainee needs more training. The Process Supervisor coordinates additional training for Trainees. The Trainee must acknowledge they've read and understood the TrainingCase after additional training.
If the Trainee indicates the TrainingCase does not apply to their job, the Process Supervisor reviews the Trainee response and determines if the TrainingCase truly doesn't apply to the Trainee's job. If the Process Supervisor doesn't concur with the Trainee's decision the TrainingCase is sent back to the Trainee. The Trainee must acknowledge they've read and understood the TrainingCase if the Process Supervisor doesn't concur.
Once all Trainees have responded the TrainingCase is closed.
