<p><b>Scope: </b>Based on a previously scheduled appointment, the Client attends their scheduled appointment and provides the Clinic Staff information necessary to determine and/or perform treatment. The Clinic Staff creates or updates the Client Medical Record with new or updated information. Based on the disposition of the Client, the Clinic Staff determines test requirements. If the Client does not require testing (such as latent Tuberculosis), the Clinic Staff reviews medications requirements with Client and tracks medication usage. If the Client has active disease, the Clinic Staff reviews medical requirements with the Client, completes tests, tracks medications, sets up contact investigation, and provides outreach services. CDC 72 A, B, and C for Tuberculosis and post HIV testing is required by the state and regularly posted to the Public Health Information Network depending on the disposition of the Client. The Clinic Staff report HIV/AIDS and other reportable data using the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS), National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) among others.

If an inadvertent duplication of record exists, the system provides the Clinic Staff the ability to consolidate multiple Client Medical Records into a single Client Medical Record based on the latest Client Demographics - no information is lost during record merge - procedure requires a secondary Clinic Staff review. The Clinic Staff use the system to review and collect Client Demographics and Client Information consisting of, but not limited to test results, scanned documents, attribute values of traditional forms such as TB Form 400A/B among others, medication and immunization records, client medication and vaccine requirements, disease/virus contact information, registration form details, etc. The system allows for undocumented/non-US citizen Client Medical Record to track medication usage. The system compartments Client Medical Records and provides access depending on the role assigned to Clinic Staff - e.g., STD, WIC, Immunization, etc. unless specifically unlocked for view and or update by designated Clinic Staff within boundaries of governing privacy controls. The system tracks access to all records. The system provides the ability for approved city staff to define new entry forms with specialized values to include lists of elements to ensure consistency of collected values. The system allows Clinic Staff to identify and recall forms once created. The system provides Clinic Staff the ability to attach vaccine history information provided by the health care provider/client, per recommendations from the Center for Disease Control - could include report from refugee camps supported by International Organization for Migration (IOM) or United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The system allows electronic import of Electronic Disease Notification (EDN).

Depending on the test need, lab results come from Internet sites such as Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Clinical Pathology Laboratory (CPL), Oxford Diagnostics, and University of Florida (via fax) and Clinic Staff watch daily for Client test results. Where applicable, the system automatically processes Test Results when interfaces exist. Automate important test results to the maximum extent possible.

Only approved roles can enter medication and treatment indication in Client Medical Record. The system automatically tracks current inventory against dispensed medications indicated in the Client Medical Record and notifies the staff based on modifiable thresholds of the need for Medication Order. Attributes of Medication Usage include (but not limited to) number of pills dispensed, lot number, manufacturer, name of medication, and prescribed dose.
