<p><b>Scope: </b>In certain situations, a Client is due a refund from the City of Austin. Normally this is the result of a customer paying and then the Health Plan Provider also paying the same claim. When this situation occurs, the Billing Staff accesses TWICES, TMHP, PaymentTech (if original payment was via credit card) and verifies the treatment and the amount paid. The Billing Staff completes a COA Request for Refund form and obtains the Billing Supervisor's approval signature. If the refund is cash or check, HHS Accounting prepares and sends a check to the Client. For credit card transactions, the Client returns to the treatment location, offers the credit card used for the original transaction, and the Billing Staff uses the card to reverse the charge via the credit card terminal. Lastly, the Billing Staff modifies the ExcelTrackingLog, reflecting activity with the customer and claim.
