<p><b>Scope: </b>The Billing staff use the system to manage unpaid or partially paid claims. Currently, the Billing Staff uses TMHP and TWICES to verifying and reconciling the details associated with a medical insurance claim. If the health plan in question requires additional documentation, the Billing Staff prepares the required letters to the Health Plan Provider, including copies of records showing the claims and treatments provided. If the Health Plan Provider offers a Website for claims, the Billing Staff uses the Website to submit the appeal; otherwise, the Billing Staff creates a CMS1500 form and resubmit the claim with the most current information. The Billing Staff then updates the Medicaid conversion database and an Excel tracking log used to track claim submissions. As the last step, plan providers file CMS1500 claim submissions.
