<p><b>Scope: </b>A qualified refugee Client reports to the Refugee Health Clinic for screening. On first visit, the Client completes various intake forms to provide consent, medical history, etc. representing the Client Demographics. During clinic visits, the Clinic Staff performs various medical testing such as blood work, vision, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, etc.), basic hearing test, and take physical vitals (height, weight, etc.). Clinic Staff administer vaccinations based on vaccine history provided by Center for Disease Control (CDC) - sometimes the CDC provides refugee Client information in the form of Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) - could include report from refugee camps supported by International Organization for Migration (IOM) or United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Based on this information, the Clinic Staff administers appropriate vaccines or medications. Sometimes Clinic Staff must wait for test results prior to administering some medications or vaccines. Client appointments occur in house for two appointments to make an overall assessment; afterwards, Clinic Staff dispense refugee Clients to civilian health care agencies. Clinic Staff may refer sexually transmitted disease (STD) or Tuberculosis (TB) cases to the Austin STD/TB Clinic. The Clinic Staff maintains a complete refugee Client Medical Record, which requires civilian health care agencies to fax health record information for inclusion in Client Medical Record. In addition, all refugee Clients receive medical education. Clients may receive additional follow up appointment if needed.

<td>The Client retrieves their Client Medical Record from the system using a Web portal - this provides technology opportunity for Client mobile service application. The system provides an acceptable form of identity management meeting the criteria established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Client uses the system to update Demographic Information using a Web portal - the Client may also use the system Web portal to review, save and print their Client Medical Record to include shot records, financial transactions, etc. The Web portal provides the Client the ability to complete intake items prior to their scheduled Clinic appointment. The system provides the Client HIPAA guidelines, as well as other immunization forms (consent, vaccine information statement, etc.) through the Web portal. [Note: The Client can only access their Client Medical Record if one already exists. Only the Clinic Staff can create new records because they must adjudicate potential duplicate records - for HIPAA (confidentiality) reasons, this may not be possible via self-service.]</td>
