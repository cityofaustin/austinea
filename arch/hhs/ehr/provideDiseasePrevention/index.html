<p><b>Scope: </b>For economically disadvantaged Clients (Medicare, Medicaid, un-insured, under-insured, or high risk, etc.), the system provides the Client a Web portal to access their Client Medical Record to intake relevant information prior to an appointment. They may use the Web portal to print or save medical information to include, but not limited to shot records, etc. The Client reports to the Clinic Receptionist (i.e., Clinic Staff) by appointment or walk-in. The Clinic Staff verifies Medicaid patients using Texas Medicaid Healthcare Partnership (TMHP), looks up immunization history in Texas-Wide Integrated Client Encounter System (TWICES) and the state's immunization tracking system ImmTrac. The Clinic Staff reviews the Client Medical Record and makes adjustments as required or creates a new Client Medical Record if none exists. The Clinic Staff uses the system to determine immunization needs and administers immunization with approved consent. The system provides a mobile platform for outreach Clinic Staff to perform field-administered immunizations for certain high-risk Clients. Once administered, the Clinic Staff enters medication/immunization administered in the Medication Usage portion of the Client Medical Record. The system tracks medication/immunization usage against supply to identify reorder thresholds when required. The system automatically provides a Medication reorder to the Electronic Vaccine Inventory system to track inventory Vaccines for Children (VFC). The Clinic Staff uses the system to track certain case files requiring workflow management and reminder notifications. Clinic Staff use the system to document state reportable public health education activities and events.

The system provides an acceptable form of identity management meeting the criteria established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Client uses the system to update Demographic Information using a Web portal - the Client may also use the system Web portal to review, save and print their Client Medical Record to include shot records, financial transactions, etc. The Web portal provides the Client the ability to complete intake items prior to their scheduled Clinic appointment. The system provides the Client HIPAA guidelines, as well as other immunization forms (consent, vaccine information statement, etc.) through the Web portal. [Note: The Client can only access their Client Medical Record if one already exists. Only the Clinic Staff can create new records because they must adjudicate potential duplicate records - for HIPAA (confidentiality) reasons, this may not be possible via self-service.]</td>
