<p><a href="establishProspect/index.html">Establish Prospect</a>:
The Event Representative, who could be the actual Customer or a Third
Party, contacts the Austin Convention Center for information about a
potential event. The Sales Manager determines if the customer is viable
based on a number of factors and if promising, establishes a Customer
Account (or use existing customer account.) The Sales Manager uses the
system to check availability of space and check for conflicts. If the
event size and booking criteria requires external involvement, the
Sales Manager may request Internal Operations Expert to provide
operational consulting and coordinate with Visitors Bureau/Hotels to
coordinate bid proposal until Visitors Bureau/Hotels settle on dates.
Once dates are established, the Sales Manager uses the system to
reserve prospective space and create the initial bid. The Sales
Director uses the system to approve the initial Proposal. The Sales
Manager reviews the Proposal with the Event Representative and uses the
system to apply any necessary changes to the bid. The Sales Manager
uses the system to cancel an event or update space reservation. [Note:
If the desired space is on hold for a group, the system allows a
'second option' designation in case the space becomes available. When
the space becomes available, the sales Manager is notified by the
system of the new availability.]</p><br>
            <p><a href="scheduleSiteVisit/index.html">Schedule Site Visit</a>:
The Sales Manager uses the system to check the schedule to determine if
there are conflict (appropriate time to show space, availability of
staff.) The Sales Manager determines who should attend the site visit
(catering , IT, event coordinators, security, etc.) and invite them to
attend and then sends an email to all appropriate site staff to ensure
the building is active (lights on, water fountains on, etc.). [Note:
Some vendors do not want others to be able to see the convention center
while they are renting (private meetings, secret info presented, etc.)]</p>

            </p>
            <p><a href="prepareContractAddendum/index.html">Prepare Contract and/or Addendum</a>:
For a requested contract, the Event Representative contacts the Sales
Manager and requests a contract. The Sales Manager determines the
customer needs input from one of the Internal Operational Experts. The
Sales Manager uses the system to add pricing, deposit and concession to
prepare the initial contract. The Contract Administrator uses the
system to enter contract details and create the initial invoice. The
system notifies the Sales Manager to evaluate the contract. The Sales
Manager and the Contract Administrator use the system to enter and
evaluate contract details until approved. The Event Representative may
request event cancellation at any time. If contract changes are
required, the Sales Manager may require legal, risk management, and
facility review. The Contract Administrator uses the system to update
the Contract. Once changes are acceptable, the Event Representative
signs the Contract. Once the Event Representative receives payment, the
Contract Administrator uses the system to record payment received for
contract and the Department Director signs the contract. The Contract
Administrator uses the system to update the customer's event to
Definite status.</p>

review Contract Terms. When a resale is in effect, the Sales Manager
uses the system to create a reminder to schedule staff activities. The
Sales Manager uses the system to engage Accounts Receivable to either
return money collected, bill event representative for owed money, or
keep money collected.</p>

            <a href="createEventUtilityPacket/index.html">Create Event Utility Packet</a>:
The Utility Services Coordinator receives a trace (activity)
Notification from the system 3-6 months prior to an Event with a
reminder to use the system to create an Event and associated Client
Packet and Exhibitor Packet with a Cover Letter as a PDF document and
email it to the Client. The Utility Services Coordinator uses the
system to examine event specifics and notes the Contract ID for the
Event. The Client Packet has a select amount of utility services that
are not included on the Exhibitor Packet and vice versa. The Utility
Services Coordinator uses the system to enable the Event for Online
Ordering. Online Ordering is a Web-based portal allowing the Event
Representative to order and pay for their desired utility services for
a specific Event. Both Client and Exhibit Packets include utility
services with three pricing levels to include incentive, standard and
floor rate. The incentive rate applies to utility services ordered by
the incentive deadline date. Standard rate is the standard price for
the utility services. Floor rate charged for utility services ordered

directly with the Event Representative regarding their needs, answering
questions, etc. Within 30 days, the Utility Services Coordinator sends
the Client an estimate for their requested utility services. Within 7
days of the event, the Utility Services Coordinator creates a utility
Pre-Plan. The Client and Consultants (i.e., Audio Video Consultant,
Decorator Consultant, Catering Operations Manager, etc.) provide floor
diagrams with desired electrical and technical services indicated with
exact locations and are included in the utility Pre-Plan. The Event
Services Coordinator emails the utility Pre-Plan to Maintenance
Supervisor and IT Business Systems Analyst. The system provides a Web
portal by which external partners (Audio Video Consultant and Decorator
Consultant, parking, and Catering Operations Manager, etc.) can examine
details associated with the event and provide feedback to the Event
Coordinator at any time. This provides a more global view of resources
required for multiple events.<br>

the Survey Contact List (Event Representative contact names and email
addresses). The Event Coordinator is able to modify the Survey Contact
List as needed and submits it for approval by the Survey Approver. The
