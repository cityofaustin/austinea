<p><b>Scope: </b>For a requested contract, the Event Representative
contacts the Sales Manager and requests a contract. The Sales Manager
determines the customer needs input from one of the Internal
Operational Experts. The Sales Manager uses the system to add pricing,
deposit and concession to prepare the initial contract. The Contract
Administrator uses the system to enter contract details and create the
initial invoice. The system notifies the Sales Manager to evaluate the
contract. The Sales Manager and the Contract Administrator use the
system to enter and evaluate contract details until approved. The Event
Representative may request event cancellation at any time. If contract
changes are required, the Sales Manager may require legal, risk
management, and facility review. The Contract Administrator uses the
system to update the Contract. Once changes are acceptable, the Event
Representative signs the Contract. Once the Event Representative
receives payment, the Contract Administrator uses the system to record
payment received for contract and the Department Director signs the
contract. The Contract Administrator uses the system to update the
customer's event to Definite status.</p>
