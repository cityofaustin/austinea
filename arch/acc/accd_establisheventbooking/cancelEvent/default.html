<p><b>Scope: </b>At any time in the booking process, the Event
Representative can cancel their event. The Sales Manager uses the
system to cancel an event. If the event is tentative or definite, the
Sales Manager uses the system to request release of space and create a
Cancellation Notice. If in receipt of a deposit, the Contract
Administrator uses the system to review Contract Terms. When a resale
is in effect, the Sales Manager uses the system to create a reminder to
schedule staff activities. The Sales Manager uses the system to engage
Accounts Receivable to either return money collected, bill event
representative for owed money, or keep money collected.</p>
