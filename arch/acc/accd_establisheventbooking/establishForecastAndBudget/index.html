</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><b>Scope: </b>The Sales Manager and Internal Operations Experts use
the system to enter events as forecast items up to five Fiscal Years in
advance. Forecasts use Fiscal Year boundaries modifiable at any time.
Budgets also use Fiscal Year boundaries and cannot be modified once
approved by Chain of Command. The Budget and Forecast includes all
estimates for an event for each of the revenue categories (facility
gross rental, credit food and beverage, room night credit, facility
net, damages, equipment rental, technical services, utility services,
telecom, general labor, security, garage daily, garage validation,
garage contract, garage total, catering, audio visual, rental, scooter
rental, retail sales, shoe shine, and other concessions). The system
must have the ability to add new Revenue Categories. [Note: The Budget
is submitted to the City of Austin Budget Office in May and is approved
by September.]</p>
