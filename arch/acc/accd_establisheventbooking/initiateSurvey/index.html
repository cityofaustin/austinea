<p><b>Scope: </b>Within a pre-defined number of days from Event
completion, the system sends a Notification to the Event Coordinator
reminding them to initiate the Survey. The Event Coordinator uses the
system to identify the Survey Contact List (Event Representative
contact names and email addresses). The Event Coordinator is able to
modify the Survey Contact List as needed and submits it for approval by
the Survey Approver. The system notifies the Survey Approver that a
Survey Contact List is ready for approval/modification. The Survey
Approver uses the system to review and modify the Survey Contact List
of and approves the Final Survey Contact List. The system sends
notification of the approval to the Event Coordinator. The Event
Coordinator uses the system to send the approved Survey Contact List to
the Survey Company. Upon receipt of the Survey Results (in PDF format),
the Event Coordinator uses the system to upload the Survey Results and
attaches them to the Event.</p>

<tr>
<td>FS051<br>Establish Event Booking/<br>specifySurveyContactList</td>
<td>No later than the last day of the Event, the system sends the Event
Coordinator a notification, reminding them to initiate the Survey
Process. Within five days after Event completion, the Event Coordinator
uses the system to choose Event Representative Contacts provided on the
system to be part of the Survey Contact List. Salutation, name, and
email address must be present for a person to be included. The Event
Coordinator creates additional contacts as needed to the Survey Contact
List. The Final Survey Contact List includes the Survey Issuance Date
and the date on which the Survey should be conducted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FS052<br>Establish Event Booking/<br>notifySurveyApprover</td>
<td>The system sends a notification to the Survey Approver indicating a
new Survey Contact List has been created and needs review and approval.
The Notification includes the Event Name and provides a hot link to the
form/interface on the system in which Survey Contact List is approved.
The system automatically understands the Contract ID and Event to which
the Survey Contact List belongs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FS053<br>Establish Event Booking/<br>approveSurveyContactList</td>
<td>The Survey Approver uses the system to review the Survey Contact
List. The Survey Approver examines all salutations, names and email
addresses and edits/deletes or adds contacts to the Survey Contact List
as needed. Added Contacts are automatically stored to the Contact
Information for the specific Event to which the Survey belongs
(guaranteeing their inclusion in the next Survey for this Event). The
Survey Approver uses the system to approve the final Survey Contact
List.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FS054<br>Establish Event Booking/<br>notifyEventCoordinator</td>
<td>When the Survey Contact List is approval, the system sends
notification to the Event Coordinator indicating the Survey Contact
List has been approved and includes the Event Name for which the survey
was created and a link to the approved Survey Contact List.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FS055<br>Establish Event Booking/<br>createSurveyContactListFile</td>
<td>On approval of the Survey Contact List, the system generates the
required Survey Contact List File, an Extensible Markup Language (XML)
output file of Survey Contacts expected by the Survey Company. The
Survey Contact List File contains a list of ID, contract number, venue,
event name, event begin, event end, full name, salutation, email,
deleted, time stamp, and the survey issuance date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Survey Company/<br>performSurvey</td>
<td>The Survey Company receives the Survey Contact List File through
their File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site (by the date of the Survey
Issuance Date included in the Survey Contact List File) and conducts
the Survey. Upon completion of the Survey, the Survey Results are sent
to the Event Coordinator Supervisor (or Manager) and the Survey
Approver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FS056<br>Establish Event Booking/<br>attachSurveyResultsToEvent</td>
<td>The Event Coordinator uses the system to access the Event for which
the survey was accomplished and attaches the Survey Results to the
event. The system provides a mechanism for tagging the attached file
with a description, keywords, and date and time attached. [Note: It is
desirable for this function to be automated.]</td>
