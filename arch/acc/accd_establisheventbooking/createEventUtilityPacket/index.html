<p><b>Scope: </b>The Utility Services Coordinator receives a trace
(activity) Notification from the system 3-6 months prior to an Event
with a reminder to use the system to create an Event and associated
Client Packet and Exhibitor Packet with a Cover Letter as a PDF
document and email it to the Client. The Utility Services Coordinator
uses the system to examine event specifics and notes the Contract ID
for the Event. The Client Packet has a select amount of utility
services that are not included on the Exhibitor Packet and vice versa.
The Utility Services Coordinator uses the system to enable the Event
for Online Ordering. Online Ordering is a Web-based portal allowing the
Event Representative to order and pay for their desired utility
services for a specific Event. Both Client and Exhibit Packets include
utility services with three pricing levels to include incentive,
standard and floor rate. The incentive rate applies to utility services
ordered by the incentive deadline date. Standard rate is the standard
price for the utility services. Floor rate charged for utility services
ordered during the Event. The Utility Services Coordinator communicates
directly with the Event Representative regarding their needs, answering
questions, etc. Within 30 days, the Utility Services Coordinator sends
the Client an estimate for their requested utility services. Within 7
days of the event, the Utility Services Coordinator creates a utility
Pre-Plan. The Client and Consultants (i.e., Audio Video Consultant,
Decorator Consultant, Catering Operations Manager, etc.) provide floor
diagrams with desired electrical and technical services indicated with
exact locations and are included in the utility Pre-Plan. The Event
Services Coordinator emails the utility Pre-Plan to Maintenance
Supervisor and IT Business Systems Analyst. The system provides a Web
portal by which external partners (Audio Video Consultant and Decorator
Consultant, parking, and Catering Operations Manager, etc.) can examine
details associated with the event and provide feedback to the Event
Coordinator at any time. This provides a more global view of resources
required for multiple events.</p>
