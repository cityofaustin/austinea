</td></tr></table>


<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Utility Services Coordinator receives a Trace/Notification from the System 3-6 months prior to the Event with a reminder to use the Utility Services Manager (USM) System to create an Event and associated Client Packet and Exhibitor Packet with a Cover Letter as a PDF document and email it to the Client. The Utility Services Coordinator uses the System to examine Event Specifics and notes the Contract ID for the Event. The Client Packet has a select amount of Utility Services that are not included on the Exhibitor Packet and vice versa. The Utility Services Coordinator uses the system to enable the Event for Online Ordering. Online Ordering is a web-based portal allowing the Event Representative to order and pay for their desired Utility Services for a specific Event. Both Client and Exhibit Packets include Utility Services with three pricing levels: Incentive, Standard and Floor Rate. The Incentive Rate applies to Utility Services ordered by the Incentive Deadline Date. Standard Rate is the standard price for the Utility Services. Floor Rate charged for Utility Services ordered during the Event.
The Utility Services Coordinator communicates directly with the Event Representative regarding their needs, answering questions, etc. Within 30 days, the Utility Services Coordinator sends the Client an Estimate for their requested Utility Services. Within 7 days of the Event, the Utility Services Coordinator creates a Utility Pre-Plan. Floor Diagrams with desired Electrical and Technical Services indicated with exact locations, are received from the Client, AV Contractor and Decorator Contractor, Catering Operations Manager and are included in the Utility Pre-Plan. The Event Services Coordinator emails the Utility Pre-Plan to Maintenance and IT. 
The System provides a web portal by which external partners ( AV Contractor and Decorator Contractor, Parking, and Catering Operations Manager ) can examine details associated with the event and can provide feedback to the Event Coordinator at any time. This provides a more global view of resources required for multiple events.</p>
