</td></tr></table>


<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Maintenence Worker uses the System to review work order assignments from the Maintenence Supervisor. They Evaluate the Duty Plan, examining the priorities specified, and choose a "START TIME" for the Work Order Item on which they are about to work. The System will only allow one work item to be started. all other items started will be paused until they are subsequently started again. Once a work order item is completed, the Maintenence Worker chooses "finished." The System tracks the start date, start time, completed date, completed time, and the composite time for each task. 
During the Work Order maintenence, new or existing parts may be provisioned via the Materials Planner, approvals or rescheduling may be needed from the Maintenence Supervisor. 
Sometimes Security Staff is needed for gaining access to secured areas. (Money room, accounting room, First aid room, Locked down areas, vandalism, building damage, etc. )</p>
