<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>Attached is the information for the "Check In or Check Out Inventory" use case that was reviewed last week with the Convention Center Team. Please take a moment to check the work and let me know if there are any changes I can make to improve this, or if this requirement is as discussed!

<!-- Use Case Scope  -->

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Employee accesses the system, and indicates they would like to check out an inventory item. If the employee has the proper skill set, and the item is not reserved or currently in use, the Employee is granted access. If the item is checked out or already reserved the Employee is presented with an option to make a reservation. If necessary, the system communicates with the Key Watcher software to unlock the appropriate keys. The employee can provide a reason for the check out, the work order, the project, and based upon the type of equipment must provide feedback on the condition of the item when it's checked out as well as back in. </p>
