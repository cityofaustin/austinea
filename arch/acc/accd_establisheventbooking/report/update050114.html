<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Event Representative can, at any time in the booking process Cancel their event. The Sales Manager may also need to cancel an event. The Sales Manager Accesses the system and the associated customer record, to annotate the reason for the cancellation. If the EVENT is set to PROSPECT, the Sales Manager can change the status to CANCELLED. </p>

<p>If it's in a TENTATIVE state, the Sales Manager schedules an Activity (trace) with the contract Administrator to release space, Cancel the event in system, and all related documents /calendar entries, etc are marked as CANCELLED. Notifications are sent internally to the all Staff (including accounting) already involved in the event planning. The Sales Manager chooses whether the system should automatically generate a "Cancellation" notice, which is sent to the Event Representative (sometimes the Sales Manager will manually construct their own personalized message.)</p> 

<p>If it's in a DEFINITE state (contract executed), the Sales Manager schedules an Activity (trace) with contract Administrator to release space, Cancel the event in system, and all related documents /calendar entries, etc are marked as CANCELLED. Notifications are sent internally to the all Staff already involved in the event planning. Contract Administration will Notify Accounting whether deposits received should be returned. The Contract Administrator will ask the Sales Manager to check if a RESALE clause is in the contract and the financial implications. The Sales Manager chooses whether the system should automatically generate a "Cancellation" notice, which is sent to the Event Representative (sometimes the Sales Manager will manually construct their own personalized message.) </p>
