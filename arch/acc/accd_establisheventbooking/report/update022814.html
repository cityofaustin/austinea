<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Once the Event is contracted, the Event Coordinator opens the Customer Account and examines the Booking Information (determines needs for the day, analyze everything about Account that Sales has given them.) The Event Coordinator takes planning information from the Client and inputs that info into the System, using ACCD standards and conventions.
The Event Coordinator creates a Time-line by adding a new Event Line. This could be one of many items: Event name, time and location(unlock doors at 6am, general session 10am, etc.) Prefunction space, Dock Space, Security Details, timing for setup and teardown by both internal employees and Vendor, Move-In/Move-Out days/times, Registration, Book Signings, Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner Food Functions, Plated versus Buffet Meals, Breakouts & Meetings, Bag Stuffing, Trade Show Open, Client Staff Show Offices, Computer Labs, Poster Sessions, Food & Beverage, room changeovers, room refresh. Each are all outlined as part of the Time-line. 
The timeline may include meeting room schedule details (location, start date/time, end Date/time, meeting title, speaker name, private or public), added by the Event Coordinator or the event Representative via a Web Portal. The Results of this time-line may be used to populate digital signs. 
The System allows for the addition of new Work Order Items as well as the use of predefined (drop-down) type selections. 
The Event Coordinator also includes Booking Notes (free flow of information that the system does not allow by predefined value lists, ie. Digital Signs and marquees, Vendor Contact Information, Timing of things that will happen outside of the contracted space, ie. pickup/dropoff of items by a decorator or Contractor. Equipment Lists, ie. where all Water Coolers need to be placed in the building. Shuttle Bus information. Hotel Information as it relates to Service Needs, ie. Security, Parking. 
The System additionally allows for the creation of "Template profiles" - these are groups of Event Items which can be reused for future Work Orders. 
An Event has a Event Work Order for the contracted Space, and separate Event Work Orders for each day of the Event with associated Event Items for all of the Services required. Each of the Work Orders is associated by a common Contract ID for the Event.
The Event Coordinator inputs information (Equipment, Labor, Security, Utilities, Parking, Food & Beverage, Damages) for each Day of the Event (note: Unit Charges for Line Items are variable from Event to Event). 
After all information has been entered, The Event Supervisor reviews the Event Work Orders, provides feedback, and the Event coordinator researches and modifies the Event Work order as appropriate. A notification (email, text or scheduled activity) is routed to Accounting with attached Work Orders and Itemized Work Order Items.    </p>
