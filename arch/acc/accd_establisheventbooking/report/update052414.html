<p>Hi All,</p>

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Utility Services Coordinator uses the system to select a pre event plan associated with a Contract ID and generates associated Work Orders. Work Orders include the following data: event representative name, contact information, booth identification, list of services, and additional notes from the Utility Services Coordinator. Later, Internal Operations Expert uses a mobile devise to access the Work Orders. Prior to the event move-in date, the Internal Operations Expert uses a mobile device to review the Work Order and perform the work to install and test the service. The Internal Operations Expert notes the installation of the service, at which time the following data elements are collected: installer name, contact information, date, time, and additional notes. On the first day of the event, the Utility Services Coordinator uses a mobile device to create a checklist of event Work Orders and performs an audit to ensure proper service instillation. If the services in the booth are not the services ordered, the Utility Services Coordinator uses a mobile device to create a Supplemental Work Order. If the Event Representative determines that services are missing or not operational, they use a mobile device to access the Work Order and generate a Supplemental Work Order containing one or more service items. If the Supplemental Work Order results in an outstanding balance, the Event Representative uses a mobile device to process payment of the balance. The Payment Gateway sends a notification to the Event Representative and the Utility Services Coordinator with indication that payment has been made. The Utility Services Coordinator uses the system to access the Supplemental Work Order and approves it for provisioning. The system sends a notification to the Event Representative that their work order has been approved for provisioning. The system sends a notification to the Internal Operations Expert notifying them a Supplemental Work Order has been created and approved for provisioning.</p>

<!-- Table definition -->
<table align="center" id="custom">
<tr><th width="195">Type/Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Establish Event Booking/ <br /> generateWorkOrder</td> <td>The Utility Services Coordinator uses the system to lookup an Event Pre-Plan using a Contract ID to list the associated Work Orders. Work Orders include event representative name, contact information, booth identification, list of services, and additional notes entered by the Utility Services Coordinator. The system generates all the Work Order items to be processed by the Internal Operations Expert. 
 </td> </tr>
 
<tr>
<td>Establish Event Booking/ <br /> displayWorkOrderList</td> <td>Using a mobile device, the Internal Operations Expert use the system to select an Event Name of interest provided by an enumeration list. The system provides a list of Work Order items ordered by location (includes booth number). The Work Order listed items are based on specialized roles such as Event Maintenance, Show IT, Security Coordinator, and Utility Services Coordinator (gets entire list).</td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Establish Event Booking/<br /> indicateWorkOrderStatus</td> <td>Based on the Work Orders, the Internal Operations Expert accomplishes the service needs identified on the Work Order. Using a mobile device, the Internal Operations Expert or the Utility Services Coordinator uses the system to indicate Status change. Status indications include pending, completed, and verified. If it's the Internal Operations Expert, the Status change is completed - if it's the Utility Services Coordinator, it's verified. Status change captures user identification, date, time, an associated notes if entered. If a Work Order item is unable to be accomplished the Internal Operations Expert leaves the Status as pending and adds a note regarding the condition of the pending Work Order item. In the case of a floor audit, the Utility Services Coordinator may also include a note in the Work Order item.</td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Establish Event Booking/<br /> createSupplementalWorkOrder</td> <td>If the services in the booth are not the services ordered (i.e., disparity in the work order), the Utility Services Coordinator uses a mobile device to create a Supplemental Work Order. The Supplemental Work Order may include but not limited to event name, contract identification, list of services, product information, quantity, company name, booth number, notes etc. Alternately, the Event Representative (for exhibitors only) may determine that services are missing or not operational. The Event Representative uses a mobile device to generate a Supplemental Work Order containing one or more service items. Services items may be conditional for example, the order of additional IP address may require a switch, or a specific Product may require additional labor, based upon quantity. Any Work Order Item can be reversed to provide a mechanism for Refund/Credits. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Payment Gateway/ <br /> processPayment</td> <td>The Event Representative reviews their order, enters their credit card information (credit card number, expiration date, name as shown on card, card type, security code, zip code, email address), and processes the payment for their order. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Payment Gateway/<br /> notifyOfPayment</td> <td>The Payment Gateway sends the Event Representative and Utility Services Coordinator an email notification of processed payment which includes contract ID, event name, payment total, last 4-digits of card.</td> </tr>
