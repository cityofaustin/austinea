<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>A Work Order Requester accesses the system through a web portal. They Requester enters a request. The Materials Planner quality reviews the Work Order Request and creates a work order if one is needed. The system pre-populates the information from the work order request to the work order. 
If the Materials Planner needs more information, the Materials Planner provides comments on the request and the Requester is notified additional information is needed. 
If the Materials Planner determines the request is a duplicate or an inappropriate request, the Materials Planner provides comments on the request and the Requester is notified the order request has been declined. 
The system can automatically create a work order from a predefined preventative maintenence schedule. 
The Requestor can be a Caterer, Tenants, or Staff. </p>
