<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Event Representative, who could be the actual Customer or a third Party, contacts the Austin Convention Center for information about a potential event. The Sales Manager will determine if the customer is viable based on a number of factors and if promising, will establish a Customer Account (or use existing customer account.) The Sales manager will then check Availability (space people etc, allowing for overlaps), will check conflicts between Types of groups, discuss group needs with the client (IT,Security,Catering, vendor etc), will coordinate potential dates with the Visitor's Bureau and various hotels, and in appropriate cases, will prepare a bid, Reserve Space, Create pricing, Submit an initial bid to customer (includes options), Negotiate / Revise event space / Revise Bid, and followup within set specific time frames.</p>
<p>
Note: If the desired space is on hold for a group, the system allows a "second option" designation in case the space becomes available. When the space becomes available, the sales Manager is notified by the system of the new availability. </p>
