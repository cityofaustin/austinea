<p>Hi All,</p> 
</div>

<p>Attached is the information for the "Perform Waste Management" use case that was reviewed October 10th, 2014, with the Convention Center Team. Please take a moment to check Jeff and My work and let me know if there are any changes we can make to improve this, or if this requirement is as discussed! Major Kudos to Jeff for basically drafting this use case on his own. Great Work Jeff!</p>

Additionally, I wanted to remind you about the Online repository of Convention Center Use Cases ( /arch/acc/report/report/index2.html )

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Waste Collector collects waste from receptacles around the facility and then asks the Waste Sorter to sort and weigh the Waste. The Waste Sorter sorts and weighs the Waste and uses the system to input Waste Log Information. Upon saving this information, the system automatically sends an email notification to relevant staff, notifying them of the waste that was just sorted, weighed and logged. On a daily basis, the system evaluates Waste weight and quantity totals and if these exceed waste thresholds, an email notification is sent to the Waste Sorter to inform them that a Waste Vendor Pickup is required. The Waste Sorter calls the appropriate Waste Vendor to request a pickup and receives a projected Waste Pickup Date. The Waste Sorter uses the system to input the Waste Pickup Date, in the process creating a Waste Pickup Request. The Waste Vendor arrives at the facility and collects the waste, providing the Waste Sorter with a Waste Vendor Receipt. The Waste Sorter uses the system to search for the Waste Pickup Request and logs the Waste Pickup Date Actual value as well as scans and embeds a copy of the Waste Vendor Receipt. 
NOTE: Waste collection reports are generated on a monthly basis to compare Waste Weights and Waste Amounts with projected totals to ensure the facility maintains its LEED certification status. </p>

<tr>
<td>Waste Vendor/<br /> pickupWaste</td> <td>The Waste Sorter contacts the appropriate Waste Vendor (using Waste Vendor Information) to request waste pickup.

<tr>
<td>Provide Safe And Clean Space/<br /> logWastePickupDate</td> <td>The Waste Sorter uses the system to create a Waste Pickup Request (creating a Waste Pickup Request ID and a Waste Pickup Request Date) and they input the Waste Pickup Date provided to them by the Waste Vendor. </td> </tr>
