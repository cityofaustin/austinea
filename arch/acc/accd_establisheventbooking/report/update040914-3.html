<!-- Use Case Scope  -->

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Event Representative contacts the Sales Manager and indicates they are ready to sign a contract to lock in an event/date/etc.
The Sales Manager requests the Contract Administrator prepares an initial contract, and to change the status of the Booking to "Tentative" . The Contract Administrator prepares the deposit schedule, enters the contract into EVT CONTRACT system (providing address, contract ID, contractor, description, contacts, date, show date, Texas association designation, estimated attendance, Ledger ID, event classification, published in calendar designation.) 
The Contract Administrator prepares the contract documents (The Contract Administrator then uses the EVT Invoices system to create an Event Invoice). The Contract Administrator uses the System to modify and reassign Activities to the Sales Manager and/or the Contract Administrator. They Print the contract, take the Contract Documents to the Sales Manager for Approval. The Sales Manager provides feedback (applies any changes needed). The Sales Manager takes the document(s) to the Sales Director for an approval. Once approved, the Sales Manager or Contract Administrator (the Contract approver) (depending upon the Facility Location) scans the document and emails a PDF of the initial contract, including Cover Letter and Initial Invoice per request to the Event Representative. 
The Event Representative reviews the Contract and associated documents and will ask questions, request changes, etc. Depending upon the request, City Legal is engaged, or the Contract Approver, or an Internal Expert for business decisions. If necessary the contract is re-drafted, and re-approved by the Contract Approver, and sent back to the customer for reconsideration. The process continues to repeat until the Event Representative and the Convention Center have mutually agreed upon terms. For every modification needed, a new Contract is drafted, including Calendar Letter, Cover Letter and other associated Documents. The Contract Administrator uses the System to modify internal Traces/Activities.
The Event representative returns the contract with an authorized signature including all Associated Documents (Photo Authorization Form and Credit Card Authorization Form). The Contract Administrator reviews the signed Contract to determine if there are further modifications made to the Contract. If there are further changes, the Contract is returned to the Sales Manager or Contract Administrator (depending upon Facility Location) and the modification process continues until a 'Clean Copy' or Contract with signature and no further modifications has been received.
The Contract is not submitted to the Department Director for signature until deposit monies as required by the Contract are received, processed and verified using either the Payment Gateway or Accounts Receivable. The monies due for deposit are contingent on the terms agreed upon within the contract (0% [government, grand-fathered, special interest group] -100%). Once the Contract Deposit terms are met and the Payment has been confirmed as received, the Contract is routed to the Department Director for final signature.
The Certificate of Insurance, and each Deposit has a due date and if the associated due dates are missed, the system will send emails to the Sales Director, and a configurable team, to indicate action is required with the customer. 
Once the Department Director has signed the contract, The Contract Administrator changes the status of the event from TENTATIVE to DEFINITE. The Contract Administrator modifies or re-assigns Activities/Traces to the Sales Manager or Contract Administrator.
Other documents (certificate of insurance, Calendar Letter, Photo Release, Credit Card Authorization Form) are provided by the event representative.
The Contract Administrator will not prepare a contract without the following initialed documents. Note, no signatures are provided until the last step of the process. 
The System tracks changes to contracts.</p>
