            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Scope: </b>The Contract Compliance Supervisor uses the system to locate
and display a Contract, create an associated ContractReviewAssignment and enter
ContractReviewAssignmentInfo. Upon storing the ContractReviewAssignment, the
system automatically creates a new Contract Review and the ContractReviewStatus
is set to 'In Progress.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ContractReviewAssignment is needed for a number of reasons: Discernment on the
part of the Contract Compliance Supervisor or because the system created an
AssignmentRequest or based upon the Ranking of a previous RiskAssessment. The
system daily searches for Contract Review Assignments to begin within 60 days,
30 days, 5 days and notifies the appropriate Contract Review Creator that a
Contract Review is due. The Contract Review Creator uses the system to locate
and display a Contract by searching for the VendorName or ContractNumber. Next
they choose an associated ContractRiskAssessment with which a ContractReview is
associated. The Contract Review Creator selects the newly created
ContractReview and uses the system to store ContractReviewInfo. The Contract
Review Creator provides all Answers to the ContractReview questions and uses
their skills and judgment to set a MonitoringLevel for each Answer. If needed,
the Contract Review Creator creates and stores a ReviewFollowupComment. If the
ContractReviewStatus has a value of 'Published', the ContractReview can no
longer be modified. Finally, the Contract Review Creator changes the
ContractReviewStatus to 'In Review.'<o:p></o:p></p>

DateClosed (stored by the system when the ContractReviewStatus is changed to

changed to 'Published'), RecommendationAndRequirements (limited to 1,000

ContractReviewInfo. If a mobile device is used, the mobile app displays all
Contract Reviews of ContractReviewType 'On-site' for the specific Contract
Review Creator that are of ContractReviewStatus 'In Progress'. The Contract
Review Creator uses their skills/judgment to set a MonitoringLevel. Finally,
the Contract Review Creator changes the ContractReviewStatus to 'In Review',

Contract Review Creator is using a mobile app to change the
ContractReviewStatus to 'In Review', the ContractReview is no longer visible in

when all follow-up work has been completed and this modification can be made by
any user of the system. ContractReviews have a ContractReviewStatus: In
Progress, On Hold, In Review, Published, Closed. If the ContractReviewStatus
has been reviewed by the Contract Compliance Supervisor and is 'Published', the
ContractReview can no longer be modified, with the exception of the
ReviewFollowup data elements. Changing the ContractReviewStatus to 'Published'
can only be done by the Contract Compliance Supervisor or their designee. All
edits made to the ContractReviewInfo by the Contract Review Creator are audited
by tracking AuditTimeLog data (EditStartTimestamp, EditDetail [how many field
values changed], and EditEndTimestamp). Additionally, any modifications made to
the ContractReviewStatus are stored in the AuditStatusLog. The AuditStatusLog
stores the following information: IsDeskReview, IsOnsiteReview,
StatusChangedTo, CreationTimestamp. The Contract Review is printable in its
entirety by clicking a 'Print Contract Review' button.<o:p></o:p></p>
