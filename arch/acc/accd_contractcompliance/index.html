Contract Item</a>: <br>
</p>The Contract Item Creator uses the Contract Manager system to
display a Contract by searching for the ContractVendorName or the
ContractNumber and creates a ContractItem, entering ContractItemType
(Deliverable or Term &amp; Condition) and entering either
ContractDeliverableInfo or ContractTermConditionInfo. If applicable,
the Contract Item Creator next stores ContractDeliverableFrequencyInfo
and clicks a button to generate one or more
ContractDeliverableDates.&nbsp;<p><br>

</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">The system daily searches for Contract Deliverables past due
and sends a ContractComplianceNotification to the appropriate Contract
Compliance Verifier. Notification appears in the form of one email per
ContractDeliverable, stating a ContractDeliverable is past due and contains an
attached file. The Contract Compliance Verifier double-clicks the attached file
and is taken to a screen that displays ContractDeliverableInfo. The Contract
Compliance Verifier enters ContractDeliverableVerificationInfo and, if needed,
a VerificationComment.<o:p></o:p></p>

            <p><a href="createriskassessment/index.html">Create Risk Assessment</a>: <br>
</p>
            <p>The Contract Compliance Supervisor uses the system to display a
Contract in need of a Risk AssessmentAssignment. The
RiskAssessmentAssignment could be needed because of discernment on the
part of the Contract Compliance Supervisor or because the system
created an AssignmentRequest, based upon the Ranking of a previous
RiskAssessment. The Contract Compliance Supervisor uses the system to
display the Contract and stores RiskAssessmentAssignmentInfo. The
system automatically creates the Risk Assessment, entering a default
RiskAssessmentStatus of 'Assigned.' On a daily basis, the system sends
a notification to the Risk Assessment Creator, instructing them to
begin work on a Risk Assessment for a specific Contract. The Risk
Assessment Creator uses the system to display the Contract and locate
the assigned Risk Assessment and change the RiskAssessmentStatus to 'In
Progress.' The Risk Assessment Creator store RiskAssessmentInformation
that includes (but is not limited to) Categories, Numbers, Questions,
MaxPoints, Scores and Comments. The Risk Assessment Creator provides
all Answers and enters corresponding Scores, using their skills and
knowledge. Comparing the TotalScore to the MaxPoints allowed, the
system provides a Ranking of Low Risk, Medium Risk or High Risk. Based
upon whether the Ranking is High or Medium, the system automatically
creates an AssignmentRequest for the Contract Compliance Supervisor.
Finally, the Risk Assessment Creator changes the RiskAssessmentStatus
to 'In Review'.</p>

            <p><a href="performcontractreview/index.html">Perform Contract Review</a>: <br>
</p>
            <p>The Contract Compliance Supervisor uses the system to locate
and display a Contract, create an associated ContractReviewAssignment and enter
ContractReviewAssignmentInfo. Upon storing the ContractReviewAssignment, the
system automatically creates a new Contract Review and the ContractReviewStatus
is set to 'In Progress.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ContractReviewAssignment is needed for a number of reasons: Discernment on the
part of the Contract Compliance Supervisor or because the system created an
AssignmentRequest or based upon the Ranking of a previous RiskAssessment. The
system daily searches for Contract Review Assignments to begin within 60 days,
30 days, 5 days and notifies the appropriate Contract Review Creator that a
Contract Review is due. The Contract Review Creator uses the system to locate
and display a Contract by searching for the VendorName or ContractNumber. Next
they choose an associated ContractRiskAssessment with which a ContractReview is
associated. The Contract Review Creator selects the newly created
ContractReview and uses the system to store ContractReviewInfo. The Contract
Review Creator provides all Answers to the ContractReview questions and uses
their skills and judgment to set a MonitoringLevel for each Answer. If needed,
the Contract Review Creator creates and stores a ReviewFollowupComment. If the
ContractReviewStatus has a value of 'Published', the ContractReview can no
longer be modified. Finally, the Contract Review Creator changes the
ContractReviewStatus to 'In Review.'</p>
