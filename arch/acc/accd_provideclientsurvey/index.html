            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Scope:</b>&nbsp; The Event Coordinator uses the system to prepare the Survey
for an Event.&nbsp; Using a SurveyTemplate (initially configured in cooperation
with a User Experience Professional), the Event Coordinator generates the new
Survey, includes EventInformation, a SurveyCloseDate and indicates the approved
SurveyContactList is ready for import. At an interval predefined during system
configuration, the system imports the approved SurveyContactList and the Survey
is made ready. On the specified SurveyIssuanceDate, the system sends a
notification to each SurveyRespondent on the SurveyContactList, using the
designated NotificationMethod (Email, Text, Both). The SurveyNotification
greets the SurveyRespondent by their Name and invites them to participate in
the Survey for a specified Event and states the SurveyCloseDate. The
SurveyRespondent selects a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) contained within the
SurveyNotification and is asked whether they grant permission for their
responses to be published for marketing purposes. The Survey then asks which
services the SurveyRespondent utilized during the Event. Based upon these
selections, the Survey expands or contracts to only show relevant questions to
the SurveyRespondent and the estimated minutes to complete the Survey are
adjusted. The Survey is wizard-driven and as the SurveyRespondent moves from
one screen to another the system stores their SurveyAnswers. If the
SurveyRespondent leaves the Survey prior to completing it, they are presented
with an option to set a number of SurveyReminderDays in which to be reminded to
complete the survey. At specified intervals, the system runs a scheduled task
upon itself to search for IncompleteSurveys. For every IncompleteSurvey, the
system sends a SurveyNotification to the SurveyRespondent. The
SurveyNotification includes a message, greeting the SurveyRespondent by their
Name and reminding them to complete the Survey for a specific Event, states the
SurveyCloseDate and contains a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) unique to the
SurveyRespondent. When the SurveyRespondent has answered all of the
SurveyQuestions to their level of satisfaction, the SurveyRespondent clicks a
button to complete the Survey and submit all SurveyAnswers to the system. The
system presents a message to the SurveyRespondent, stating the Survey has been
completed and thanks them for their feedback.<o:p></o:p></p>

comments may be used in whole or part on the Austin Convention Center website

Survey next asks what EventServices were utilized by the SurveyRespondent.
Based upon the selection of EventServices, the Survey expands or contracts to

adjusted accordingly and the SurveyStatus is change from Pending to Started.
The Survey allows for bridging and skipping, based upon answers chosen (eg.
answering one question indicates that the SurveyRespondent may skip over the
next block of questions). The Survey contains one or more SurveySections. Each
SurveySection contains one or more SurveyQuestions. The SurveyQuestions have
the option of being multiple choice questions along with fields for the
SurveyRespondent to provide feedback in their own words. Multiple choice
question types include (but are not limited to): Choose all that apply, Choose
one, Choose one from a scale (eg. 1-5). The SurveyRespondent provides
SurveyAnswers. The Survey is wizard-driven and as the SurveyRespondent moves
from one page to another the system stores their SurveyAnswers. Each screen of
the Survey contains a progress bar, indicating to the SurveyRespondent where
they are in the process of completing the Survey. The SurveyRespondent has the
ability to move forward or backward in the Survey at any time. If the
SurveyRespondent leaves the Survey prior to completing it, they are presented
