<p><b>Scope: </b>At any time during daily operations, the Route Supervisor uses a geospatial map to load route templates and/or modify Driver routes. When the Route Supervisor creates a route change, the system updates the Driver's map Route information and notifies the Driver and Dispatcher of the change. The Dispatcher and Route Supervisor map shows near real-time Driver position sent from mobile device. The system provides the turn-by-turn audio and video instructions, which the Driver may disable the audio. When the Driver Route deviates beyond the thresholds settings of the device, the system provides an audible warning and notifies the Dispatcher and Route Supervisor. As the Driver collects and empties carts, the system scans and stores radio frequency identification (RFID) information possibly using Bluetooth technology or similar wireless technology to communicate information with the mobile devise. The system collects and reports Route information and uploads the required Route information incrementally throughout the day. The system interfaces with the City's Customer Care and Billing system to report services requiring extra charges. The Route Supervisor, Dispatcher and Driver communicate using voice over IP (VOIP) or similar technology when needed. The system uses push-to-talk similar to hand-held radios and the system records all communications including text messaging and email when needed.

<tr><td>At any time during daily operations, the Route Supervisor uses a geospatial map to load route templates and/or modify Driver routes. The Route Supervisor may use crowd-sourcing tools such as Waze or other mapping, navigational application to provide the situational awareness of route conditions to reroute Drivers around incidents or road congestion. Ideally, the Route Supervisor map displays real-time traffic information as a geospatial overlay on the Driver positional location and Route. When the Route Supervisor creates a route change, the system updates the Driver's map Route information and notifies the Driver and Dispatcher of the change. The Dispatcher and Route Supervisor map shows near real-time Driver position sent from mobile device. Drivers stay on the assigned Routes unless the Route Supervisor approves a deviation. Approved city staff set route deviation warning thresholds.</td>

<tr><td>The mobile device uses a touch screen interface and provides push-button controls to quickly move between the information collection and presentation points. The system provides the turn-by-turn audio and video instructions, which the Driver may disable the audio. When the Driver Route deviates beyond the thresholds settings of the device, the system provides an audible warning and notifies the Dispatcher and Route Supervisor. As the Driver collects and empties carts, the system scans and stores radio frequency identification (RFID) information possibly using Bluetooth technology or similar wireless technology to communicate information with the mobile devise. When a Customer sets out extra refuse, the system provides the Driver a means to input the amount and type of refuse and ensures application of applicable charges with Customer Care and Billing (CC&amp;B). For special conditions such as damaged, missing carts, or contaminated recycle carts (i.e., inappropriate refuse), the Driver uses a wireless hand-held device to record evidence using relevant media (e.g., photography or video) to upload to the system and stored with the daily Route information and easily observable by the Dispatcher, Route Supervisor or other approved city staff. The system inserts a notation on the picture or video of the responsible customer. The Route information collected by the system includes, but is not limited to, the ability to collect carts set out rate, routes driven, miles driven, accelerometer information, time on route, seat belt use, truck weight, and gross vehicle weight. The mobile device uploads the required Route information incrementally throughout the day representing the entire daily actuals. The mobile device is permanently fixed to the Driver's console and ergonomically accessible. The mobile device must be ruggedized to survive in harsh environments.</td>

The system uses push-to-talk similar to hand-held radios and the system records all communications including text messaging and email when needed. The system uses Long-Term Evolution (LTE), commonly marketed as 4G LTE, a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones or similar technology.</td>
