<p>The following Unified Modeling Language (UML) use-case models identify the functional requirements of our desired Vehicle Fleet Technology Upgrade (VFTU) system. Our proposed operational process provides contextual reference and scope understanding. However, the contractor may propose alternative processes or technologies - we encourage innovative solutions. The contractor may propose any solution configuration such as hosted or internal. However, we prefer a Cloud solution - i.e., Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS). The contractor may collaborate with a Cloud provider and propose a development activity using PaaS. The city provides a fully functional IBM Integration Bus (IIB), enterprise service bus (ESB) to include an ESB instance in our demilitarized security zone to interface with internal city applications such as Customer Care and Billing discussed in our use-case model. The City identified the required performance response in each table describing interface descriptions shown on the adjacent sequence diagram. If the contractor is proposing a PaaS or other software development solution requiring development activity, provide qualifications and past performance of similar functional experience rather than describing an existing proposed technology performance. 

<p><a href="http://austinea.org/arch/arr/collectRouteAndDriverInformation/">Collect Route and Driver Information</a>: At any time during daily operations, the Route Supervisor uses a geospatial map to load route templates and/or modify Driver routes. When the Route Supervisor creates a route change, the system updates the Driver's map Route information and notifies the Driver and Dispatcher of the change. The Dispatcher and Route Supervisor map shows near real-time Driver position sent from mobile device. The system provides the turn-by-turn audio and video instructions, which the Driver may disable the audio. When the Driver Route deviates beyond the thresholds settings of the device, the system provides an audible warning and notifies the Dispatcher and Route Supervisor. As the Driver collects and empties carts, the system scans and stores radio frequency identification (RFID) information possibly using Bluetooth technology or similar wireless technology to communicate information with the mobile devise. The system collects and reports Route information and uploads the required Route information incrementally throughout the day. The system interfaces with the City's Customer Care and Billing system to report services requiring extra charges. The Route Supervisor, Dispatcher and Driver communicate using voice over IP (VOIP) or similar technology when needed. The system uses push-to-talk similar to hand-held radios and the system records all communications including text messaging and email when needed.</p>

<p><a href="http://austinea.org/arch/arr/ensureCustomerCartNeeds/">Ensure Customer Cart Needs</a>: During daily operations, customer carts may inadvertently fall or slip into the truck's hopper, require repair or replacement, or require a change in service. The system provides the Driver a lost cart indication. Using the system, the Driver confirms a cart is lost in truck's hopper. On the Route Supervisor's route display, the system provides indication of lost cart in hopper, including Cart Identification information. The system displays the same information on the Dispatcher's display. The system uses the customer Cart Identification to identify the Customer in the Customer Care and Billing system to provide notification via text message or email of the lost cart and the anticipated replacement schedule. During daily operations, the Driver uses the system to identify a cart as needing repair or replacement. The system stores cart repair or replacement information along with the Cart Identification information. The system provides a queue mechanism to assist in efficient routing for Cart Maintainer staff. Customers call Austin Energy to open or close an account for services with Austin Resource Recovery or to make other changes to services. The Customer Care and Billing system updates the Cart Identification information and updates the system with pickup or delivery schedule. The Cart Maintainer use the system to navigate to scheduled daily cart locations based on service requests for repairs or replacements. After making repairs or replacements, the Cart Maintainer enters action taken or assigns new Cart Identification information with the cart customer.</p>

<p><a href="http://austinea.org/arch/arr/serviceBrushBulkAndHHWRequest/">Service Brush, Bulk, and Household Hazardous Waste Request</a>: The 311 Call Advisor creates service requests for brush, bulk, and household hazardous waste via Motorola's Citizen Service Request (CSR) system. CSR also provides a customer self-service Web portal to allow customers to submit requests online. The 311 Call Advisor uses the system to indicate the type of refuse requested. The 311 Call Advisor uses CSR to generate a brush, bulk, or household hazardous waste work order - CSR processes the work order request with the system. For required audit work orders, the system notifies Supervisor to determine cost for out of cycle pickups. The Supervisor uses the system to determine daily out of cycle audit assessments to establish cost to service the work order. The system assigns audit needs based on geospatial information relevant to the assigned work area of the Supervisor. For excess refuse bags or other debris removal, there may be additional charges that apply. The Driver or Operations Staff use the system to enter extra items removed. The system logs the pickup information and provides a queue mechanism to assist in efficient routing for appropriate Operations Staff. The system displays the daily pickup information on the Operational Staff's mobile device using a geographic information system (GIS) map for optimal routing guidance. The pickup staff uses a mobile device to indicate pickup volumes and types recovered. If a service request (work order), the Operations Staff uses the system to close the request and/or to indicate condition and status serviced through 311 Advisor and the CSR system.</p>
