<p><b>Scope: </b>An Employee involved or witness to a reportable Incident Event calls the Dispatcher to report the initial details of the Incident Event. The Dispatcher uses the system to log the initial reported details of the Incident Event, the event location and selects from a list of Incident Types stored in the system. Depending on the Incident Event, the Dispatcher contacts the appropriate Emergency Responder. Triggered by changing status of an Incident Event and selected Incident Type, the system automatically notifies a predefined chain of command and Responders via email, text, pager message depending on profile setup and configuration. The identified Responder acknowledges receipt of the Incident Event (in the Notification) and travels to the notified location. Using a mobile device, the identified Responder indicates arrival on scene by selecting a link in the Incident Event Notification and the system provides status indication to the Dispatcher. Depending on the disposition of the Employee, the Supervisor ensures Employee medical attention by escorting or following the emergency response team to medical treatment facility. Using a mobile device, the system provides the Supervisor a template form to create the initial Incident Report criteria details. Previous information already created by the system such as Incident Event information already logged by the Dispatcher, Acknowledgment and Response Indication pre-populate the Incident Report form. Once the Incident Report is complete, the Supervisor submits the Incident Report. Based on the Incident Type, the system distributes the Incident Report to designated recipients.</p>
