<p><b>Scope: </b>During daily operations, customer carts may inadvertently fall or slip into the truck's hopper, require repair or replacement, or require a change in service. The system provides the Driver a lost cart indication. Using the system, the Driver confirms a cart is lost in truck's hopper. On the Route Supervisor's route display, the system provides indication of lost cart in hopper, including Cart Identification information. The system displays the same information on the Dispatcher's display. The system uses the customer Cart Identification to identify the Customer in the Customer Care and Billing system to provide notification via text message or email of the lost cart and the anticipated replacement schedule. During daily operations, the Driver uses the system to identify a cart as needing repair or replacement. The system stores cart repair or replacement information along with the Cart Identification information. The system provides a queue mechanism to assist in efficient routing for Cart Maintainer staff. Customers call Austin Energy to open or close an account for services with Austin Resource Recovery or to make other changes to services. The Customer Care and Billing system updates the Cart Identification information and updates the system with pickup or delivery schedule. The Cart Maintainer use the system to navigate to scheduled daily cart locations based on service requests for repairs or replacements. After making repairs or replacements, the Cart Maintainer enters action taken or assigns new Cart Identification information with the cart customer.</p>

<tr><td>During daily operations, customer carts may inadvertently fall or slip into the truck's hopper. The system provides the Driver a lost cart indication. Using the system, the Driver confirms a cart is lost in truck's hopper. The system ensures a cart in truck dump arm when returned to downward position to verify cart lost in hopper. When a radio frequency identification (RFID) picks up the customer information such as name, phone number, address, etc., this information is stored with the lost cart indication. Current cart inventory provides a small number of carts with an RFID device. If RFID does not exist, the system displays a list of known addresses in the surrounding area for the Driver to make a visual determination of the appropriate address selection - e.g., the system correlates Customer address with the cart number or the Driver makes address observation.</td>

<tr><td>During daily operations, the Driver uses the system to identify a cart as needing repair or replacement. When the vehicle's radio frequency identification (RFID) identifies the cart, the Driver uses the system to indicate observed cart condition and recommended repair or replacement actions required. When no RFID or RFID is unreadable, the system displays a list of known addresses in the surrounding area for the Driver to make a visual address determination or use the system to determine address from the cart number. The Driver uses a portable hand RFID scanner or cart number to identify damaged carts when the vehicle lift mechanism is unable to scan the cart.</td>

<tr><td>The system stores cart repair or replacement information along with the Cart Identification information. The system provides a queue mechanism to assist in efficient routing for Cart Maintainer staff. The queue ensures fair, responsive cart replacement or repair by efficiently concentrating cart maintenance needs within typical workday delivery zone. For carts that fall/slip into the hopper within the vicinity of the daily planned service deliver, replacement information shows up on that day's delivery schedule and provide the appropriate Route Supervisor cart replacement status to ensure 48-hour replacement turnaround. The system tracks cart count inventory prior to accepting replacement of fall/slip carts by Cart Maintainer staff. When Cart Maintainer cannot replace the fall/slip carts within 48-hour window, the system provides Route Supervisor cart status indication of need to replace the cart.</td>
