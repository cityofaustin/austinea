Austin City Code §2-11-15. Until expiration of retention period, hardware and software must be available to access records and sufficient metadata must be present to facilitate timely retrieval of records. Contracts with hosted solution providers must specify the contractor’s duties with respect to management of records as required by Austin City Code §2-11-15.
