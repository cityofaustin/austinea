<p><b>Scope: </b>The 311 Call Advisor creates service requests for brush, bulk, and household hazardous waste via Motorola's Citizen Service Request (CSR) system. CSR also provides a customer self-service Web portal to allow customers to submit requests online. The 311 Call Advisor uses the system to indicate the type of refuse requested. The 311 Call Advisor uses CSR to generate a brush, bulk, or household hazardous waste work order - CSR processes the work order request with the system. For required audit work orders, the system notifies Supervisor to determine cost for out of cycle pickups. The Supervisor uses the system to determine daily out of cycle audit assessments to establish cost to service the work order. The system assigns audit needs based on geospatial information relevant to the assigned work area of the Supervisor. For excess refuse bags or other debris removal, there may be additional charges that apply. The Driver or Operations Staff use the system to enter extra items removed. The system logs the pickup information and provides a queue mechanism to assist in efficient routing for appropriate Operations Staff. The system displays the daily pickup information on the Operational Staff's mobile device using a geographic information system (GIS) map for optimal routing guidance. The pickup staff uses a mobile device to indicate pickup volumes and types recovered. If a service request (work order), the Operations Staff uses the system to close the request and/or to indicate condition and status serviced through 311 Advisor and the CSR system.</p>

<tr><td>The 311 Call Advisor creates service requests for brush, bulk, and household hazardous waste via Motorola's Citizen Service Request (CSR) system. CSR also provides a customer self-service Web portal to allow customers to submit requests online. The 311 Call Advisor uses the system to indicate the type of refuse requested (e.g., brush, bulk, and household hazardous waste). The 311 Call Advisor uses CSR to generate a brush, bulk, or household hazardous waste work order - CSR processes the work order request with the system. For required audit work orders, the system notifies Supervisor to determine cost for out of cycle pickups.

<tr><td>The Supervisor uses the system to determine daily out of cycle audit assessments to establish cost to service brush, bulk, and household hazardous waste work order. The system assigns audit needs based on geospatial information relevant to the assigned work area of the Supervisor. The system tracks the number of requests per household to allow for a set number of free service requests before billing for the service. The number of free service requests is adjustable by approved city staff. The Supervisor uses the system to enter assessed volume/amount of audited material and associated cost relevant to the servicing household.</td>

<tr><td>For excess refuse bags or other debris removal, there may be additional charges that apply. The Driver or Operations Staff use the system to enter extra items removed. Based on the type and volume of services entered (extra refuse bags, additional debris removal, etc.), the system applies required charges to the Customer Care and Billing (CC&amp;B) system.</td>

<tr><td>The system logs the pickup information and provides a queue mechanism to assist in efficient routing for appropriate Operations Staff. The system displays the daily pickup information on the Operational Staff's mobile device using a geographic information system (GIS) map for optimal routing guidance. GIS indicates pickup points and communicates location information to the Dispatcher and Supervisor device. The queue determines fair and responsive pickup schedule by efficiently concentrating pickup needs within typical workday delivery zones.</td>

<td style="font-weight: bold; background: lightgray;">Provide Waste Pickup and Reduction/servicePickup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The pickup staff uses a mobile device to indicate pickup volumes and types recovered. When a Supervisor previously performed an assessment audit, the system uses the volumes and types assessed. The system stores information to provide analysis of waste type and volume to determine if customer training and/or other waste management functions provide an effect on the amount and type of waste collected. If a service request (work order), the Operations Staff uses the system to close the request and/or to indicate condition and status (including notes) serviced through 311 Advisor and the Citizen Service Request (CSR) system. The user interface is simple to use and intuitive for simple routine information entry and push button (icon) focused to the maximum extent possible.</td>
