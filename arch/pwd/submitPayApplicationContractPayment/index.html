<p><b>Scope</b></p>
<p>The Contractor submits a draft Pay Application for requesting payment. The Inspector reviews the Pay application and compares it to the Quantity Book. Materials on Hand, Statement of Deductions, Contract Time Statement, and Recapitulation Sheet are supporting documents required with the Pay Application. 
</p> <p>
If there are discrepancies, the Draft Pay Application is returned to the Contractor for modification/correction and resubmission. When the Inspector approves the Pay Application, the Inspection Supervisor reviews and compares it to the Quantity Book and approves it. The Project Manager reviews (such as Progress Schedule or other pertentant items) and approves. Contract Management handles the Subcontractor Compliance Report (SubK) for compliance metrics (Small Minority Business Resources SMBR). The Pay Application is reviewed by Accounts Payable for submittal to Controller for payment.</p>

<tr>
<td>Project Manager/ <br /> reviewPayApplication</td> <td>The Project Manager uses their check list to verify various elements of the Pay Application. The Project Manager checks eCapris and the project files for claims against the City or the Contractor. Additionally the CT Number is checked to confirm its accuracy. The monthly sub contractor report is verified, ensuring the listed firms are listed in the approved compliance plan, and checks for Are-firms-listed-working-on appropriate-scopes for this Pay Application, verified. If either of these need correction a request is sent to the Contractor to provide a request for change of compliance plan.They ensure the vendor name and address are the same as within AIMS. Ensure signatures are original or acceptable format. They Verify funding sources on the pay app with distribution amount shown per line item where there are multiple funding sources (recapitulation sheet vs AIMS/eCapris.) Ensure pay app shows both prime contractor as well as endorsee (if applicable). For ROCIP (Rolling Owner Controlled Insurance Program) ensure ROCIP payment form is attached. Ensure funding for all change orders has been encumbered.If this is final payment, the Project Manager checks MBE/WBE (Minority Business/Women owned Business) closeout form is signed by contractor and SMBR (Small and minority Business Resources) department (and attached).Check General Section 700 items: consent of surety (Bond number,amount, name of Surety, Surety Address) (with power of attorney), certificate of insurance (policy Dates, insurance company, effective dates, amount covered) through warranty period , affidavit of all bills paid. "Nonuse of Asbestos after contract" document. Operational Manuals. As Builts (record documents, Contractor, foreman, Start date and End date). Documentation of Notice to Claimants.
