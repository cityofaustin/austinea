</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td>Administer Capital Constuction Data/ <br /> addDailyReportInfoToProject</td> <td>The Inspector accesses the system, specifies the project, selects a day or date range, and adds Daily Report information as necessary. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Administer Capital Constuction Data/ <br /> recordTestResults</td> <td>The Inspector indicates one of the uploaded documents is a test result. The system offers a different screen requesting Pass/Fail and metric information about the specific test. Additionally the Inspector indicates WHICH test was conducted, date test was conducted, and by whom. The system offers the inspector a radio box to check indicating "Back Charge Contractor", and another radio box to indicate "Retesting Is Required" The system sends notifications to the Project Manager and Inspector / Inspector Supervisor indicating the test results were added. </td> </tr>


<tr>
<td>Supervisor/<br /> reviewAndApproveDailyReport</td> <td>The Supervisor verifies that Daily Report is completed (all fields are filled out). Supervisor checks for completeness, public appropriate text, and factual information instead of opinion. If there are no problems the Supervisor will approve the Daily Report effectively "locking" it for any modifications. In instances where changes are needed the Supervisor, or one of their delegates, can "unlock" a Daily Report for modification. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Administer Capital Constuction Data/<br /> reviewDailyReport</td> <td>The user accesses the system, specifies the project, selects a day or date range, and reviews Daily Report information as necessary. </td> </tr>

This indicates the Supervisor has "unlocked" the Daily Report for modifications by the Inspector. The Inspector modifies the Daily Report accordingly. Upon resubmission the Daily Report will once again become locked. The system records the date, time, and user ID of the Inspector when a change is affected on the Daily Reports.</td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Field Engineer/ <br /> spotCheckSectionOfDailyReport</td> <td>The Field Engineer selects from the stack of Daily Reports. The Field Engineer randomly selects one Daily Report for review and then verifies Daily Report. The Field Engineer accesses the system and verifies the required daily reports have been posted as expected. The Field Engineer spot checks Daily Report for factual information instead of opinion, and Daily Report is filled out completely.

<tr>
<td>Administer Capital Constuction Data/<br /> performCompletenessCheck</td> <td>The Engineering Technician verifies  the Daily Progress Reports are present and accurate, as the project is now completed.</td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Contractor/ <br /> deliverRequestedReportToClient</td> <td>The user accesses the system, specifies the project, selects a day or date range, and an email address. The system prompts for the output name and location of the report to be generated and then generates a PDF formatted report at the desired location.</td> </tr>
