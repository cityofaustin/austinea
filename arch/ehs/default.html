<p><a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ehs/performFacilityHealthReview/">Perform Facility Health Review</a>: The Applicant uses the system to complete an Facility Health Application to obtain a facility health review. This may include a request for Operating Permit, a facility health inspection for general facility assessment, custodial care inspection, or health facility related complaint. Based on application attributes, the system determines applicable fees for processing with the city's approved Electronic Financial Service. Once submitted, the Facility Health Application is added to a Review Queue for quality review by an Application Reviewer. Once approved and a facility inspection is required, the system adds the reviewed Facility Health Application to an Inspection Queue. The Applicant or the Health Inspector can make modifications to the scheduled Inspection Queue and the Health Inspection Supervisor can reassign Health Inspectors. Based on Inspection Queue, the Health Inspector retrieves assigned inspections using a mobile device to retrieve location, contact, and other details of the facility to be inspected and completes an Inspection Report. Following an inspection, the system automatically updates the Inspection Queue and provides Notification to the Applicant on the details of the inspection and its status, i.e., pass or fail. When an Operating Permit is required, the system automatically generates an Operating Permit for issuance to the Applicant.</p>

<p><a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ehs/informPublicOnPestManagement/">Inform Public on Pest Management</a>: Triggered by citizen requesting a site visit for either stinging insects or rodents, the Surveillance Technician verifies ownership of site via TCAD and CC&B (by address). By appointment, the Surveillance Technician visits the site to perform area surveillance. Bait box may be placed for later retrieval. The Surveillance Technician may use rodenticide and record the amount displaced, rodenticide used, location and wind speed for state licensing compliance purpose. Record educational materials handed out such as pamphlets, etc. Free traps of various verity may be given out (also recorded). The system tracks quantity for reordering purposes.</p>

<p><a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ehs/quantifyMosquitoPopulation/">Quantify Mosquito Population</a>: Based on seasonal activities, the Surveillance Technician identifies an area interest and identifies Gravid Trap (mosquito trap) placement. Occasionally, a complaint is received by citizens which may influence trap emplacement. The Surveillance Technician places traps and uses the system (mobile device) to enter its location (currently using GPS) locator. The traps are left overnight and picked up prior to 12 PM the next day to ensure live specimens. The Surveillance Technician brings the specimens to local state lab for species identification and testing (i.e., West Nile Virus). The senior/supervisor receives the test results via email from the state lab and enters the information into the system (currently an Access Database). The supervisor converts the data to a GIS layer for upload and display on public map. If observable standing water, the Surveillance Technician may use larvacide and use the system to record the amount displaced, pesticide used, location and wind speed for state licensing compliance purposes. The Surveillance Technician sprays in unincorporated and contracted incorporated areas.</a>
