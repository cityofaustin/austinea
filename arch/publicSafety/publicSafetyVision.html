<p>I enjoyed meeting everyone and look forward to our future collaboration - the dialog was outstanding! Based on our strategic planning meeting, here's what I captured from my notes. Please review the following and provide feedback, which is always welcome. Once we establish well defined capabilities, we can begin to explore how they might be realized.</p>

<tr>
<td>Access Building Schematics</td>
<td>Many public safety events occur such as fire or burglary, which require public safety Field Workers to access building schematics for high value or complex structures. These schematics provide great insight for search, rescue, or entrapment of illicit personnel. Provides immediate, in the field (i.e., mobile), identification and retrieval of relevant up to date structure schematics or blueprints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Observe Crime Activities Through Video Surveillance</td>
<td>Throughout our city are a myriad of video surveillance cameras both government and commercially owned and operated. However, public safety entities cannot use these cameras to enhance surveillance needed to protect the safety of our community. In addition, not all government owned video surveillance systems are integrated or accessible. Such a capability also requires a video surveillance system and monitoring tools to efficiently and effectively provide surveillance information when and where needed - for example, available to Field Workers requiring video surveillance of a given hot zone or area of threat indication. Finally, Field Worker body cameras provide undisputed visual presentation of law enforcement actions during a citizen engagement event. Provides storage for video management such as retention and retrieval. Finally, an integrated video surveillance systems provides opportunity to exploit face recognition systems encouraging criminals to take their illicit activities elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Field Intelligence</td>
<td>Public safety has access to many local and national crime intelligence sources; however, much of this information is inaccessible by Field Workers. Quick and efficient field intelligence indications allows Field Workers to identify crime patterns otherwise overlooked while enhancing collaboration between Field Workers and intelligence center operators. We currently provide automatic vehicle location; however, Field Worker location provides better dispatch situational awareness of field activities to enhance crime responsiveness and Field Worker safety. Enhanced field location information also improves response time to reduce traffic fatalities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Perform Risk Management</td>
<td>Currently, user interface activities such as interacting with mobile devices through keyboards create Field Worker distractions increasing risks to Field Worker and citizens. Risk management is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities. As an example, by increasing the use of heads up displays and device voice interaction, this reduces distractions leading to incidental events.</td>
