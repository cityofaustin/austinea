<p>PDR Architecture Team,

<p>It always amazes me how quickly the simplest process gets complicated. This is our challenge as we pursue successful information technology (IT) deployments. As an example, have a look at the traditional approach using a swim-lane model by selecting the diagram. The problem with this traditional &quot;process&quot; approach is the lack of an interface point of view. The interface is how our IT systems work; therefore, we need to explore functional needs from the interface perspective to clearly define and understand how we want to use our systems. By exploring the interface perspective, we're capturing system requirements the same way developers create systems or we can more effectively evaluate commercial-off-the-self (COTS) solutions because we clearly understand how we want to use our system. We can then evaluate how well the COTS solution implements our processes and determine if the COTS process constraints are acceptable to our business activities.

<p>The following diagrams and tables represent the <b>Use Case Specification</b> for the <b><i>Perform Regulatory Review</i></b> use case. To see an overview of the process, please select the Perform Regulatory Review Interaction Overview (note how different this activity model compares to the swim-lane model). Each activity (blue, rounded corner rectangles) represent process of events shown on the sequence diagrams below. In other words, each activity has its own represented sequence diagram and the activity diagram captures the high-level business rules. This is the Unified Modeling Language (UML) way of dealing with complexity. They are numbered for your reference.

<p>Based on our last discussion, we determined that it was necessary to include a feature to allow the Submittal Applicant to submit multiple Submittal Packages prior to submitting any fee or remittance and the remittance could be paid all at once at the end of the intake process. This required some adjustments to our model to accommodate this feature. Also, we discussed providing regular feedback to the Submittal Applicant as the Submittal Package moves through the review process. These adjustments were made as well.

<p>Please review and be prepared to provide feedback during our next session. Note: If a service (a message item on the sequence diagram) was defined in a previous sequence diagram, it was not defined again if reused. This is mostly observed on <b><i>4. Review Submittal Package</i></b>. This is the object-oriented way...

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Use Case Specification<br>Perform Regulatory Review

<p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Perform Intake

<p>The Submittal Applicant inputs information and documents that represent a Submittal Package. For certain types of Submittal Packages, there's a fee required. Because a Submittal Applicant might intake more than one submittal during any given session, Remittance (fees) are stored in a Remittance Queue until the Submittal Applicant session ends.

Based on location values identified on the application form, location-based information automatically populates relevant form elements. The system provides a method to attach relevant design documents and other pertinent Submittal Package items. These required items are indicated by the Web-based form. Each required attached line item provides the ability to browse to the file, ensures all required attachments, and approved document format (such as PDF). The required items must be indicated depending on submittal type - required items must be changeable by approved city staff.</td>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Submit Remittance

<p>The system presents a list of fees (fee breakdown) associated with their related Submittal Package and provides selection to pay Remittance. The system processes the Remittance with a city approved Electronic Financial Service provider.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Quality Review Submittal Package

<p>The system provides a list of new or updated Submittal Packages for review by the Submittal Coordinator. The Submittal Coordinator reviews the Submittal Package and either rejects or accepts the submittal. If accepted, the system automatically adds the Submittal Package to the Group Review Queue. The type of Submittal Package determines the appropriate Group Review Queue entered and the order in which the groups must review the Submittal Package. If rejected, the system refunds a portion of the remittance and a portion of remittance is retained as a service fee. No matter the state of the Submittal Package, the Submittal Applicant is notified of the status of the submittal.

The review cycle is adjustable by relevant city staff. For example, some groups may need to sign off (approve or comment) before the Submittal Package shows up in another Group Review Queue. The Group Review Queue is also updated when a Submittal Package is approved or requires additional review based on Reviewer lineage (requires one reviewer to review before another). The Group Review Queue is based on area of responsibility (i.e., constructability, code compliance, etc.). The Submittal Coordinator may return a Submittal Package to the Group Review Queue indicating selected groups during the review cycle to include Submittal Coordinator comments when necessary.</td>

<tr>
<td>Submittal Applicant/<br>reviewNotification</td>
<td>The system provides an automated email to the Submittal Applicant for accepted and rejected Submittal Packages (with rejection comment - i.e., reason for rejection and recommended guidance for future submissions).

Throughout the Submittal Package review process, the system provides continuous automatic updates to the Submittal Application as it moves through the Group Review Queue.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">4. Review Submittal Package

<p>The system provides a means for a Reviewer to observe the Group Review Queue and select a Submittal Package for review. Once selected, the Group Review Queue is updated to remove the Submittal Package from the review queue to prevent simultaneous reviews. The Submittal Applicant is notified of the particular group reviewing the Submittal Package. Throughout the review cycle, a Submittal Coordinator may quality review the Reviewer Comment and provide feedback to the Reviewer by returning the Submittal Package back to the Group Review Queue to be addressed. Reviewer Comments made to the Reviewer are not provided as feedback to the Submittal Applicant. On completion of all areas of responsibility in the Group Review Queue, the Submittal Coordinator approves the Reviewer Comments for Submittal Applicant update or approves the Submittal Package for permitting.

<tr>
<td>Perform Design Review/<br>provideDesignFeedback</td>
<td>Routinely, the Reviewer in a particular review group (by order of responsibility area) checks the system Group Review Queue (listed in date/time order) for assigned reviews and submits Submittal Package Reviewer Comments. The system provides automated tools for the Reviewer to markup diagrams including comments, links to references and city codes, among other traditional markup indications to effectively communicate to the Submittal Applicant the required changes to relevant Submittal Package items. All markups indicate the particular Reviewer for identification by the Submittal Coordinator but not identified when submitted to the Submittal Applicant. The Submittal Coordinator may review Group Review Queue items and provide feedback to the Reviewer. If no comments, the Reviewer approves the Submittal Package and the Submittal Coordinator approves the Reviewer Comments or Submittal Package when no comments require updates to the Submittal Package. The Group Review Queue is per review group (depending on the type of review) and when under review (selected by a Reviewer), the system automatically takes the Submittal Package off the Group Review Queue to prevent multiple reviews by the same area of responsibility. For some reviews, depending on certain attributes identified on the application form, the system provides a priority order of review groups because some review groups may be required to review the Submittal Package and approve or comment before other groups are provided opportunity to review. The business rules for review group order must be modifiable by selected responsible city staff.</td>
