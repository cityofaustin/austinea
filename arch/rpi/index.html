<p><a href="/austinea/arch/rpi/performRegulatoryReview/">Perform Regulatory Review:</a> The Submittal Applicant inputs information and documents representing a Submittal Package and processes a Remittance with the city approved Electronic Financial Service provider if required. The Submittal Package is reviewed by a Quality Reviewer for acceptance or rejection for non-compliance and subsequent resubmission.

<!--<p>Solution Architecture - <a href="/austinea/arch/rpi/obtainSubmittalPlanApproval/">Obtain Submittal Plan Approval</a>-->

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/rpi/obtainPermits/">Obtain Permits:</a> Permit Applicant obtains single purpose trade permits or manages permits relevant to a Submittal Package/Project Information. The system provides Web interface application forms relevant to the permit requested, calculates required remittance and adds permit application to a Review Queue for Reviewer review and comment when required. Permit Applicants may also transfer Building Permits to prescribed contractors, cancel Trade Permits, and/or reactivate Expired Permits.</p>

<p><a href="/austinea/arch/rpi/obtainFinalInspection/">Obtain Final Inspection:</a> An Authorized Permit Person uses a Web interface to submit an Inspection Request (and/or supporting inspection documentation). When entered properly and quality checked by the system, the system adds the Inspection Request to an Inspection Queue and provides the Authorized Permit Person details relevant to the request such as anticipated inspection timing, city point of contact (POC), etc. The Inspector Manager may review the Inspection Queue, override system automated selections by reassigning inspector assignments or make adjustments to the inspection information. When changes are made to the Inspection Queue relevant to the Authorized Permit Person, a notification is sent to the Authorized Permit Person informing them on changes and or updates to the Inspection Request. The system provides the Inspector a geographic information system (GIS) map with priority ordered (overlay) indication of inspection locations. The Inspector may use the map to navigate to the inspection location or retrieve relevant information regarding the inspection. Once inspected, the system provides the Inspector the ability to record their inspection results, which automatically updates the Inspection Queue. If the Inspection Request is a building final inspection, the system provides the ability for the Authorized Permit Person to retrieve and print Certificate of Occupancy or Certificate of Compliance.</p>
