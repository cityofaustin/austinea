<p><b>Scope: </b>An Authorized Permit Person uses a Web interface to submit an Inspection Request (and/or supporting inspection documentation). When entered properly and quality checked by the system, the system adds the Inspection Request to an Inspection Queue and provides the Authorized Permit Person details relevant to the request such as anticipated inspection timing, city point of contact (POC), etc. The Inspector Manager may review the Inspection Queue, override system automated selections by reassigning inspector assignments or make adjustments to the inspection information. When changes are made to the Inspection Queue relevant to the Authorized Permit Person, a notification is sent to the Authorized Permit Person informing them on changes and or updates to the Inspection Request. The system provides the Inspector a geographic information system (GIS) map with priority ordered (overlay) indication of inspection locations. The Inspector may use the map to navigate to the inspection location or retrieve relevant information regarding the inspection. Once inspected, the system provides the Inspector the ability to record their inspection results, which automatically updates the Inspection Queue. If the Inspection Request is a building final inspection, the system provides the ability for the Authorized Permit Person to retrieve and print Certificate of Occupancy or Certificate of Compliance.</p>

<td>The system provides a list of permits issued to the Authorized Permit Person and provides the ability to select the desired issued permit for inspection. Alternately, the system provides a method to request inspection for single purpose permits for selected Authorized Permit Person (typically trade contractors) performing routine day-to-day activities requiring permits. The Permit Applicant can also see administrative hold on a permit – i.e., revision required, inspection resulted in work out of scope of the permit. etc. Finally, the system provides for special approved program inspections that provide a means for the Permit Applicant to schedule an inspection for a specific date and time. In addition, the system provides the Permit Applicant the ability to review and/or update Project Information. The system ensures proper order of inspection types prior to authorizing inspection request (i.e., some inspection require a particular order). </td>

Message may also include inspection results in the form of a Web link directing the Authorized Permit Person to the details of the inspection.</td>

The Inspection Supervisor may also perform a quality review of Inspection Requests. The system provides adjustable alerts such as an Inspector with too many assigned inspections, Inspector not logged in during specified inspection hours, location indication is provided by communicating the mobile device location (cost savings because AVL is no longer required), customer service indications of inspection times based on nominal, historic results etc. The system alerts the Inspector if departing the site without entering some form of inspection result.</td>

When an inspection location icon is selected, the Inspector selects location navigation to navigate to the GPS location or to obtain additional inspection information such as permit Inspection Request, relevant design documentation from intake of the Submittal Package, code and compliance details (searchable), coordination details (i.e., codes to access site), etc. The Inspector must be able to override and reassign individual inspections and inspection assignments (ability to reassign an inspection to another Inspector when specialized expertise is required).</td>
