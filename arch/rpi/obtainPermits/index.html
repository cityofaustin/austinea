This function is limited to only the alternate flow to [request a permit] or [reactivate expired permit] and designated for selected trade contractors performing routine day-to-day activities requiring permits. When a mobile home is involved (only in mobile home parks), this requires issuance of a building permit to associate relevant trade permits to the project. This type of building permit can be issued as a single purpose permit.</td>
