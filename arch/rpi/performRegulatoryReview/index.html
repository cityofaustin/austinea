<p><b>Use Case Scope:</b> The Submittal Applicant inputs information and documents representing a Submittal Package and processes a Remittance with the city approved Electronic Financial Service provider if required. The Submittal Package is reviewed by a Quality Reviewer for acceptance or rejection for non-compliance and subsequent resubmission. Accepted Submittal Packages are added to a Group Review Queue managed by a Submittal Coordinator. The system provides a means to manage the Group Review Queue and provides feedback to the Submittal Applicant based on Reviewer comments until Submittal Package approval.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Perform Intake</p>

<p>The Submittal Applicant inputs information and documents that represent a Submittal Package. For certain types of Submittal Packages, there's a fee required. The system provides a method for the Submittal Applicant to research related geographical information. Based on address information entered, the system automatically establishes geographical references. Because a Submittal Applicant might intake more than one submittal during any given session, Remittance (fees) are stored in a Remittance Queue until the Submittal Applicant session ends.</p>

<td>The Submittal Applicant uses the system to complete a Web-based application form to setup Project Information and securely sign submittal. The system guides the Submittal Applicant through a series of questions leading to the correct application to complete - experienced Submittal Applicant may bypass questions to the correct form. For routine, recurring events, the Submittal Applicant uses the system to resurrect a previous submittal for modification, update and submission. The Submittal Applicant can revisit the intake application during multiple sessions before its completion and save each session prior to submittal. In addition, the Submittal Applicant can provide updated Project Information throughout the approval process; however, the system locks Project Information during the review cycle, which can be released (unlocked) at Submittal Coordinator discretion when required to allow for Submittal Applicant updates. The system provides the ability to withdraw a project submittal as well. Based on location values identified on the application form, location-based information automatically populates relevant form elements. The form contains selectable attributes to identify mechanical, electrical, plumbing, building, driveway, sidewalk, special event etc. to predetermine initial permit requirements, which can be adjusted during quality review - when applicable, the application must accommodate multiple structures. The system provides a method to attach relevant design documents and other pertinent Submittal Package items. These required attachments are indicated to the Submittal Applicant on the Web-based form. Each required attached line item provides the ability to browse and upload the file and ensures all required attachments to include approved document format (such as PDF). The required items must be indicated depending on submittal type - required items for any given submittal type must be changeable by approved city staff.</td>

<td>The system provides the ability to perform geographic information research using city owned Geographic Information System (GIS) information. These features include the ability to overlay plan sheet with one or more GIS layers. The system provides the ability to compare a known list of features in GIS to the Submittal Package plan. These features should include zoning, jurisdiction, watershed, and other relevant planning and review information about adjacent properties. When various fragmented pages are stitched in continuous form providing an overall construction footprint, provide ability to overlay footprint on GIS view for GIS administrators to create GIS polygon overlay. This information helps conduct the review in the context of the permitted/build environment. Referenced sources are not required to be included as markup back to Submittal Applicant.</td>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Quality Review Submittal Package</p>

<p>The system provides a list of new or updated Submittal Packages for review by the Quality Reviewer. The Quality Reviewer reviews the Submittal Package and either rejects or accepts the Submittal Package. If accepted, the system adds the Submittal Package to a Group Review Queue and includes the Project Information in Issue Permits system for future permit requirements update, requests and issuance. No matter the state of the Submittal Package, the Submittal Applicant is notified of the status of the submittal to include indications why the Submittal Package was rejected for correction and resubmission.</p>

The Group Review Queue is updated when a Submittal Package is approved or requires additional review based on Reviewer lineage (i.e., requires one Reviewer to review before another or certain groups can review simultaneously). The Group Review Queue is based on area of responsibility (i.e., constructability, code compliance, etc.). The Submittal Coordinator or Reviewer may return a Submittal Package to the Group Review Queue indicating further review by selected groups or selected Reviewers during the review cycle to include Submittal Coordinator or Reviewer comments when necessary. Certain Reviewers can be set as required without holding up the review cycle; however, these reviews are still essential for final approval - allows for Submittal Applicant to receive Reviewer Comments prior to final approval.</td>

Once completion of the Reviewer process, the system provides the Submittal Applicant a reviewer completion summary and a link to download markup diagrams and associated Reviewer Comments, links to references and city codes, other general comments, among other indications to effectively communicate to the Submittal Applicant the required changes to Submittal Package items. Once corrected, the Submittal Applicant must address each comment and resubmit relevant portions of their Submittal Package. These notifications may include high-priority out of cycle comments from Reviewers. Throughout the Submittal Package review process, the system provides continuous automatic updates to the Submittal Applicant as it moves through the Group Review Queue. Finally, the Submittal Applicant is provided a means to print any necessary approved documentation. Displayed permits include QR code (or similar technology) for city staff in the field to quickly retrieve details of displayed permit.</td>

<p id="4" style="font-weight: bold;">4. Review Submittal Package</p>

<p>The system provides a means for a Reviewer to observe the Group Review Queue and select a Submittal Package for review. Once selected for comment, the Group Review Queue is updated to remove the Submittal Package from the review queue to prevent simultaneous reviews from the same group type. The Submittal Applicant is notified of the particular group reviewing the Submittal Package. Throughout the review cycle, a Submittal Coordinator may quality review the Reviewer comment and provide feedback to the Reviewer by returning the Submittal Package back to the Group Review Queue to be addressed. On completion of all areas of responsibility in the Group Review Queue, the Submittal Coordinator approves the Reviewer comments for Submittal Applicant update or approves the Submittal Package to allow for permitting. Relevant Submittal Package documents are stored in the enterprise document and imaging management system (EDIMS) for future retrieval.</p>

<td>Routinely, the Reviewer in a particular review group (by order of responsibility area setup in the Group Review Queue) checks the Group Review Queue (listed in date/time order) for assigned reviews and submits Submittal Package Reviewer Comments. For complex structures submitted in appropriate format, the system provides a means to view diagrams using layering techniques to show/hide various elements. The system provides automated tools for the Reviewer to markup diagrams (words, pictures, sketches, highlights, etc.) including associated comments, links to references and city codes, administrative/general comments, among other traditional markup indications to effectively communicate to the Submittal Applicant the required changes to Submittal Package items to include ability sort and/or rank comments. The Reviewer needs to dynamically share comments with other Reviewers and view other Reviewer's comments prior to generation reports. The system provides the ability to identify changes (deltas) for resubmitted design plans when submitted using standardized formats such as PDF and engineering computer aided design (CAD) files. The system provides the able to easily calculate volumes, measure areas (to include acreage), distances (via poly-line or path), angles and radii. The system provides the ability for multiple page document submissions to be viewed in continuous, unbroken fashion providing a seamlessly adjoined view of the design plans - within a given plan set, provide ability to navigate between section/sheet dynamically. The system provides a common, frequently used comment library to include images, text, technical specifications, etc. configurable by the Reviewer. All markups indicate the particular Reviewer layer for identification by the Submittal Coordinator and Submittal Applicant. The Submittal Coordinator may review Group Review Queue items and provide feedback to the Reviewer. The system provides reporting of group comments and general administrative comments by topic for each discipline. If no comments, the system allows the Reviewer to approve the submittal by providing a group level or individual secure approval stamp indication on relevant Submittal Package items and the Submittal Coordinator approves the Reviewer Comments or the entire Submittal Package when no comments require updates by the Submittal Applicant. Once a Review Group approves a Submittal Package, the record must be locked preventing any additional changes except by approved city staff.</td>
