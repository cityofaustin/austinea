<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Body Camera Specifications

<h1>Functional Specification</h1>

<p>The officer uses the system to login and associate the body camera device to the logged officer - provides date/time, who is driving, which car, etc. used for shift-end storage. The body camera device is securely mountable on multiple locations on the uniform (e.g., epaulette, shirt button, belt, etc.) - no matter the orientation when mounted to the outer clothing, the video is always oriented in a horizontal plain. The body camera is impact resistant, not easily turned off during struggle, and external indicators do not expose officer location in dark conditions. If the camera provides image stabilization, it must provide a disable feature. The body camera operates in low-light conditions to record the same image seen by the officer. The internal media is non-removable by the officer - only approved technicians may remove or replace media storage device. Officer must receive clear indication of low storage or near end battery life. The body camera automatically starts based on event triggers such as opening front door - could also include siren, emergency lighting, selecting voice microphone, rear door, programmable vehicle speed, and vehicle impact meta-data as needed. Other triggers include synchronization with the vehicles digital mobile audio video (DMAV) system. The body camera must include ability to manually start and stop recording. Ideally, the device replaces the body microphone with in car video wireless audio.

<p>The body camera automatically uploads wirelessly throughout the day through the car DMAV system. Once loaded to the DMAV system, the officer uses the system to add textual information further describing recorded events; however, the officer cannot edit the video. Triggered event meta-data such as door openings are stored with the video on the system. The officer may use the system to assign a classification (ex., codes such as non-event activity) and case number. Once stored in DMAV system, the system performs normal upload procedures for storage, retention, and future retrieval for investigation, public information requests, etc. For beat, bike, or mounted patrol officers, the system provides a mechanism (docking station, custom software, etc.) to perform similar functions required by vehicle driven officers using DMAV. 

<h1>Recordkeeping Functional Specifications</h1>

<p>Preservation. Recordkeeping systems must prevent the loss or unauthorized deletion of records before the expiration of their retention period as authorized by an approved records control schedule or with the written permission of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Texas Local Government Records Act §202.001(a).

<p>Integrity. Recordkeeping systems must prevent the unauthorized alteration of records before the expiration of their retention period. The system provides logs or audit trails that document edits and views of records. The system provides the ability to lock out videos for investigative purposes and limit access by role such as an assigned special investigations unit (SIU). The system provides auditing and reporting to include who accessed videos to include time and date of access.

<p>Disposition. The recordkeeping system supports the systematic deletion of records upon expiration of their retention period as authorized by an approved records control schedule or with the written permission of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Texas Local Government Records Act §202.001(a) and §201.003(16), Austin City Code §2-11-11. Sufficient metadata must be present to identify records eligible for disposition based on entered classification of events and dates. Disposition meta-data includes the ability to include multiple disposition indicators - for example, record retention disposition may be overruled by litigation requirements.

<p>Duplicates. The recordkeeping system ensures the destruction of all duplicate records, including convenience copies, upon expiration of the retention period. Texas Rules of Evidence, Rule 1003. The system's back-up strategy ensures elimination of record copies on back-ups beyond the destruction of the originals. Development teams must ensure records used to create test, perform development, or training environments comply with destruction periods.

<p>Retrievability. The recordkeeping system ensures records are retrievable and available until the expiration of their approved retention period. Texas Local Government Records Act §205.008(b). Records stored on contractor, outsourced, cloud, or hosted platforms remain the property and responsibility of the City. Contractors are required to deliver records, in all requested formats and media, along with all finding aids and metadata, to the City at no cost when requested by an authorized City employee or at completion or termination of the contract. Austin City Code §2-11-15. Retain hardware and software necessary to provide access to records until the expiration of the retention period; sufficient metadata must be present to facilitate timely retrieval of records. Contracts with hosted solution providers must specify the contractor's duties with respect to management of records as required by Austin City Code §2-11-15. The system provides the ability to convert videos to standardized formats. Video searches include but not limited to officer, case number, car number, date time range, filename, event triggers (e.g., door trigger/impact trigger), etc.

<p>Holds. The recordkeeping system ensures the protection and availability of specific records - even if their retention period has expired - if they are the subject of known or reasonably anticipated litigation, public information request, audit or other legal action. Texas Local Government Records Act §202.002, Austin City Code § 2-11-11. "Reasonably anticipated" does not mean "Just in case". The system maintains a log of litigation and other holds to release records for resolved litigation, audit, or public information requests.

<p>Records of Destruction Actions. The recordkeeping system creates records/logs of destruction activity. Texas Local Government Records Act §203.046, Austin City Code §2-11-11. Destruction logs must (a) show a minimal set of metadata sufficient to uniquely identify the records purged; (b) show who approved and who executed the destruction, and the dates on which these events took place; (c) reflect compliance with an approved, written standard operating procedure; and (d) be retained permanently.
