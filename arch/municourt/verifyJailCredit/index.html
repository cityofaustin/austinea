<p><b>Scope: </b>The Defendant requests Jail Credit Verification and presents a photo ID to the Court Clerk.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If the Defendant has a valid ID:<br>
<ul>
	<li>The Court Clerk verifies the person's identity in the case management system and retrieves the PID associated with the Defendant.</li>
	<li>The Court Clerk runs the jail credit query in Tiburon using the Defendants's name, date of birth, and time frame of incarceration to retrieve the 
	Jail Credit information and confirm that there is Jail Credit.</li>
</ul>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If the Defendant does not have a valid ID to use for confirmation of their identity then the Court Clerk directs the Defendant to the Walk-In Court to 
determine if the Judge will grant an exception. The Clerk may generate the Tiburon Jail Credit Report for the Defendant using provided demographics and 
walk it over to the court and present it to the Judge (but not delivering it to the Defendant).
