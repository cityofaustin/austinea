<p><b>Scope: </b>Jail Credit Verifications requests can be initiated by defendants who are in custody (incarcerated) or by 
	defendants not in custody (Walk-In). In either case they obtain a Jail Credit Verification form from the Court. Incarcerated 
	Defendants may request the form via the Web and Out of custody Defendants can obtain the form over the Web or by contacting 
	the Court and arranging its delivery (email/ text attachment, mail or in person at the Court Front Counter window.)  
	Incarcerated Defendants must have the form completed and delivered by a Jail Custodian. Out of custody Defendants complete the 
	form themselves.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
A Out of custody Defendant must also produce documented proof of their incarceration (dates and facility.) If the Out of custody Defendant served
	time in Travis County then their incarceration dates can be verified by a TIBURON inquiry. If the Defendant presents proof of 
	incarceration for time served in facility outside Travis County then the incarceration dates must be verified by contacting 
	the facility. Receiving a completed form from a Jail Custodian via certified mail is adequate proof of incarceration.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Court Clerk reviews the submitted form and confirms the method for determining the Defendants incarceration dates and (if everything 
	is valid and complete) forwards the documents (and Out of custody Defendant when in person) to the Central Booking Clerk to continue 
	the Jail Credit Verification process.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Central Booking Clerk processes the Jail Credit Verification form by submitting the Defendant's demographic information and 
	incarceration dates to either TIBURON for jail time served in Travis County or by contacting the jail facility outside Travis 
	County.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
If the jail time is verified and correct then the Jail Credit request is put in the Judgeâ€™s queue for review. The Judge reviews the 
	request and case information and makes a decision. If the request is approved then a judicial order is issued to Central Booking 
	to apply the jail time served to the case and reduce the balance by either a calculated amount or an amount specified by the 
	Judge. The Central Booking Clerk uses the case management system to reduce the balance due on the case and to add an action to 
	the case documenting the Jail Credit balance reduction.
