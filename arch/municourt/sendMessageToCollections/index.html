<p><b>Scope: </b>The case management system creates a collections send file (coordinated with the collections vendor) for all cases added that 
includes the citation information, vehicle information (when applicable), personal identifiers and contact information, case starting balance, 
case balance, total calculated collection fee and status for any case that is being added or is already in the collections process. The entire 
data set is transferred to the collection vendor every time there is an update or change to the data. The collection vendor evaluates the entire 
file and compares the data values for each case to what they have on record. Any changes detected are used to add to or update their records.

When the collections send file is processed all values in the file are evaluated and the collection service records are updated with any changes.
<ul>
<li>If a case is being added to collections: The case management system adds a case to a collection service queue by sending the citation information, 
vehicle information (when applicable), personal identifiers contact information, starting case balance, case balance, calculated collection fee and 
status to the collection service. Cases are sent at 1 year from file date on all non-parking and 6 months from file date for parking (configurable).</li>
<li>If the Court takes a payment on the case: The Court sends the the new balance on the case to the Collection service. The collection service updates 
their record to the new outstanding balance on the case by referencing the case number.</li>
<li>If a payment is taken on a case in collections and the payment needs to be reversed (for example: a bad check or a payment applied to the case by 
mistake) then a 'reversal' record with the reversed payment amount and the new case balance is sent over to the collections service.</li>
<li>If there is a change in case warrant status: The collection communication information is modified to add or drop references to the warrant status 
on the case.</li>
<li>If collections activity is being paused on a case due to a filed motion, scheduled appearance or the Court Clerk setting an event on the case: The 
Collections service suspends collection activity on the case referencing the case number in their records.</li>
<li>If a case is withdrawn from collections because the Defendant has been arrested, the case is dismissed, time for collection activity has expired, 
the Judge makes a collection withdrawal qualifying disposition on the case or someone other than the Defendant has submitted proof of sentence completion 
(community service or DSC): The Collections service withdraws the case from its collection activity queue.</li>
<li>If collections activity is being restarted on the case: The Collections service restarts collection activity referencing the case number in their records.</li>
<li>If the Defendant receives credit for jail time or community service then the balance on the case is reduced by that amount. The collection fee on 
the case is also recalculated using the remainder of the credited amount subtracted from the starting balance on the case as the case balance subject to 
a collection fee. The credit amount, new balance and recalculated fee are applied to the collection service record using the case number as a reference.</li>
</ul>
When the Case Management system process adds additional fees and costs to a case as the case ages, the collection service updates the case balance in 
their record using the case number as a reference.

The collection service sends a receipt to the case management system acknowledging that the case has been added to the collection queue or updated from the court's modified data supplied in the collections send file.
Return receipt format:<br>
CaseNumber, Collection Update Action Code<br>
Codes:
<ul>
<li>AD = Add - New case added to collections.</li>
<li>CF = Add Collection Fee</li>
</ul>
Recalculate the collection fee and report that to the collection vendor. As required by law, the system must recalculate the 
collection fee as partial jail time credit or community service is applied to a case in third party collections within the case 
management system. The system must log a statement indicating a collection fee was added, reduced or removed. If reduced, the 
system must log the reduced amount, date and time. The system must maintain a reference of the original collection fee amount as well.

The case management system matches the collection interface update action code to its corresponding system action 
code prior to adding the action to the case.
This method may be unnecessary but it depends on who is driving the creation of the code set. 
If the vendor collects for many courts, then they may drive the creation of the code set.
