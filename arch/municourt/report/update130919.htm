<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Downloader locates their specific case. The Downloader examines the historical log of activities against the case. The entries with unsecured documents will show an icon indicating an attachment exists. If the downloader chooses to download an attachment, they are prompted to identify themselves with an established security code (if they have not already provided the security login). If the Downloader is not authorized to access the case selected, an error will be issued. Upon successful verification, the system requests confirmation of the file to download, prompts for location, and initiates a download to the Downloader's computer.  </p>

<table align="center" id="custom">
<tr><th width="195">Type/Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Web Presence/ <br /> identifyCaseFile</td> <td>Provides a legal means of identity for Defendant or Respondent to identify Case File of interest. If there are multiple Case Files, they are presented in a tabular queue for Defendant or Respondent to select Case File of interest.</td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Manage Court Case/ <br /> retrieveCaseFileByCaseNumber</td> <td>The Web Presence interfaces with the system to retrieve a Case File based on a case number provided. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Manage Court Case/ <br /> determineOption</td> <td>When a user selects a particular Case File of interest from the Web Presence, the system determines the various options available to the User. The system provides a Municipal Court staff configurable rules engine to allow Court Staff to modify business rules associated with the options provided to the User. The rules engine provides a customizable response based on current Case File attributes such as warrant status, age of Defendant or Respondent, attorney assigned to the case, and plea state (just to name a few) leading to the options provided to the User. Depending on Municipal Court Staff needs, some responses are non-selectable and grayed out providing indication to the User why the legal option is not selectable. Because laws frequently change, it's important the options are not hard coded into the case management system; rather, the system allows the Court Staff to make appropriate option changes using customizable rules filter. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Web Presence/ <br /> selectOption</td> <td>Based on a customizable Option rules engine, the User is provided a list of options to proceed with the Case File. To reduce confusion, some of the options (determined by Court Staff) are grayed out and non-selectable with an explanation as to why the Option is not available. When selecting the option, the user is provided a confirmation of the legal option selected. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Manage Court Case/ <br /> setOption</td> <td>The User is offered a set of options and makes a selection. The Case management system is notified of the option selected.</td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Web Presence/ <br /> provideUsernameAndPassword</td> <td>A request or condition has occurred which requires identification of the User. The Web Presence prompts the user for their Last name and their Security Code. If the defendant does not have a Security code, they are offered the option to establish one.</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td>Web Presence/ <br /> selectFileForDownload</td> <td>The user has chosen an option that indicates a file will be downloaded from a case. Upon user validation, the system presents history for the case selected. The historical entries include identifiable icons indicating which have documents that can be downloaded. The users select one of the attachments for download. Note: Some attachments are not be available for download to everyone. The system allows for security levels associated with attachments.</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Court Case/ <br /> provideFileForDownload</td> <td>The User has been provided a list of files from which to select a specific file for download to their own computer. They have selected the file to download. The case management system is asked to queue up the file for download to the user.</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td>Web Presence/ <br /> confirmFileDownload</td> <td>The user has specified a file from a case to be downloaded. The system requests a confirmation from the user allowing them to "Continue" or "Cancel"</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Court Case/ <br /> initiateFileDownload</td> <td>The user has confirmed the file to be downloaded, the system has been provided the filename to be downloaded, and transfers the file to the user's computer.</td> </tr>
