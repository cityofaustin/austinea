<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Using the Web Presence, the Document Submitter selects the option to submit documentation. The Document submitter selects type of document from a predefined list derived by the business rule engine, which is then stored with the case file along with the document in question. The document is stored in the Document Submission queue and is reviewed by the Court Clerk. The document must be an image file, video recording, audio recording, Office Documents, etc, using industry standard formats. The Document Submitter is notified of document receipt, and the document is verified by the Court Clerk. If all outstanding elements of the case are provided, the Court Clerk places the Case in the Judge's queue. For cases forwarded to the Judge, the Judge makes one of two decisions, either to reject the case or to dismiss the case. If the case is rejected, the Judge adds comments to the case file and sends it back to the Court clerk. If the Case is dismissed, the case file is modified to reflect that the case is now terminated. In both cases, the Document Submitter and/or the appropriate contactee are sent notification of the state of the case following the Judge's determination.</p>

<p>Prior to the message on the sequence diagram is a Reference item [Ref] essentially identifying a preconditional element to the sequence events where the Motion Filer established the File Motion option. A summary of the reference follows:</p>

<p><b>Ref: 1. Select Legal Option</b></p>
<p>The system provides the ability for a Respondent or Defendant to manage all Case Files identified in the case management system using a Web Presence online. The system provides a legally binding form of identification to be persistent throughout the Web session. When a Defendant or Respondent selects a particular Case File of interest from the Web Presence Case File Queue, the system determines the various legal options available to the Defendant or Respondent. The system provides a Municipal Court staff a configurable rules engine to allow Court Staff to modify business rules associated with the options provided to the Defendant or Respondent via Web Presence. The rules engine provides a customizable response based on current Case File attributes such as warrant status, age of Defendant or Respondent, attorney assigned to the case, and plea state (just to name a few) leading to the legal options provided to the Defendant or Respondent. Depending on Municipal Court Staff needs, some responses are non-selectable and grayed out providing indication to Defendant or Respondent why the legal option is not selectable. Because laws frequently change, it's important the legal options are not hard coded into the case management system; rather, the system allows the Court Staff to make appropriate legal option changes using customizable rules filters. Once a Legal Option is selected, the system confirms the Legal Option and it's implication to Respondent or Defendant before storing it with the Case File. </p>
