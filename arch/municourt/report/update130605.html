<p style="font-weight: bold;">Report on 06/05/2013

<p>We're making great progress - albeit, I know there's much work to do...

<p>Please select image for larger view. We'll discuss these diagrams tomorrow to determine if we properly addressed the telepresence among other topics. I'll also introduce a new concept called interface realization. This is where we begin to recognize reusable interfaces throughout the Municipal Court processes (sort of the lego blocks Aaron Brown was referring to last week). It's also where we begin to define our future state requirements (see table below). As we evolve, we'll identify which of these interfaces represent future state functions and organize them to a future state interface description. In the end, Muni Court will have a complete set of functional requirements to deliver to the AMANDA vendor - the sequence diagrams will provide the necessary operational context - depicted as future state alternate flows.
