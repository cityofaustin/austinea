<p>Muni Court Architecture Team,

<p>Based on our Use Case work to date, I assembled the following recommended functional requirements for potential submission to CDSC. These functional requirements were developed directly from our Use Case discussions. We can also deliver our Use Case diagrams with the more detailed specifications. The summary, however, provides good context for CDSC to understand the requirement. We'll discuss further during today's session.

<p>Respectfully,
<!-- Austin Logo -->

<td>Establish Case File Legal Option : Select Legal Option - The system shall provide the ability for a Respondent or Defendant to manage all Case Files identified in the case management system using a Web Presence online. The system shall provide a legally binding form of identification to be persistent throughout the Web session. When a Defendant or Respondent selects a particular Case File of interest from the Web Presence Case File Queue, the system determines the various legal options available to the Defendant or Respondent. The system provides a Municipal Court staff configurable rules engine to allow Court Staff to modify business rules associated with the options provided to the Defendant or Respondent via Web Presence. The rules engine provides a customizable response based on current Case File attributes such as warrant status, age of Defendant or Respondent, attorney assigned to the case, and plea state (just to name a few) leading to the legal options provided to the Defendant or Respondent. Depending on Municipal Court Staff needs, some responses will be non-selectable and grayed out providing indication to Defendant or Respondent why the legal option is not selectable. Because laws frequently change, it's important that the legal options are not hard coded into the case management system; rather, the system should allow the Court Staff to make appropriate legal option changes using customizable rules filter. Once a Legal Option is selected, the system confirms the Legal Option and it's implication to Respondent or Defendant before storing it with the Case File.</td>
