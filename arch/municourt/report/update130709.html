<p>Muni Court Team,

<p>After losing some sleep over Matt's challenge to figure out a way to queue remittance and allow for Defendants to process multiple Case Files, I cracked the code. The problem wasn't as challenging as anticipated. To follow my discussion, please select the Set Criminal Case on Docket Interaction Overview (activity model). The Interaction Overview shows how all the sequence diagrams interact or tie together. Using Aaron Brown's business Lego discussion, the Interaction Overview provides a way to show how all the processes fit together. Each activity (blue, round corner rectangles) on the diagram equals a sequence diagram, which can be viewed as a specific activity. Each of the sequence diagrams are depicted later in this report to include their interface descriptions in the table below the diagram.

<p>The Interaction Overview identifies the business rules leading to the sequence of events shown on the sequence diagram. Also note, there are business rules captured on the sequence diagram (i.e., opt, alt, etc.) demonstrating how complex some processes can get - i.e., business rules inside more business rules. This is real life and the power of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that traditional modeling approaches are unable to depict.

<p>On further inspection, it would appear that this use case is more than <b><i>Set Criminal Case on Docket</i></b>, because only one leg of the flow has anything to do with the Docket (i.e., Establish Not Guilty Plea). Therefore, I'd suggest the use case should be renamed to <b><i>Establish Case File Legal Option</i></b> or something like that. We can discuss during our next meeting.

<p>Cheers!

<p><b>Select Legal Option Scope</b>

<p>The Defendant enters relevant legally binding Identity information into the system to access a list of case files and selects the Case File of interest (note: the Case File list could be just one item). Based on the type of Case File, the system provides the Defendant various Legal Options and confirms the Defendant selection.

The rules engine provides a customizable response based on current Case File attributes such as warrant status, age of Defendant or Respondent, attorney assigned to the case, and plea state (just to name a few) leading to the legal options provided to the Defendant or Respondent. Depending on Municipal Court Staff needs, some responses will be non-selectable and grayed out providing indication to Defendant or Respondent why the legal option is not selectable. Because laws frequently change, it's important that the legal options are not hard coded into the case management system; rather, the system should allow the Court Staff to make appropriate legal option changes using customizable rules filter.</td>

<p><b>Establish Not Guilty Plea Scope</b>

<p>When a not guilty plea is selected as a Legal Option, the Defendant is presented with types of Dockets to select from. When a particular Docket is selected, the system provides a Docket Schedule for the Defendant to select as a preference. An Acknowledgment of Jury Waiver is confirmed and the Docket Schedule selected and Case File is added to the Complaint Queue for future review by Court staff. The system also provides an option to request additional assistance for Defendants requiring special needs access or language interpretation.
