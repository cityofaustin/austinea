<p>Muni Court Architecture Team,

<p>I went through some of the items in the Court Draft Scope 04-13 we identified during our last session and added some recommended changes and comments for further review. Let's discuss during our next meeting. I recommend that we continue through the rest of the list to prepare for some sort of submission to CDSC. We should also examine our Use Case development work and consider submitting them as well. I spoke to Paul Hopingardner and informed him that we would have some form of input (albeit incomplete) by 31 July. According to Paul, it would be good to deliver CDSC some of our requirements even if there are more to follow.

<p>Please be advised that no requirements will go to CDSC until the Mini Court Architecture Team approves.

<p>Respectfully,

<p><b>Criticality Level Definitions</b>

<p>All requirements are assigned one of the following three criticality levels:

<ul>
<li>Must Have - these requirements are considered highly critical and must be satisfied by the CMS upgrade in some way.
<li>Expected - these requirements are somewhat critical to the end users of the CMS upgrade.
<li>Desired - these requirements would add value but are not critical.
</ul>

<td>Must Have</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>F007</td>
<td>Functional</td>
<td>The solution's public portal for Court shall have real-time updates to the database. <span style="color: red;">[This is best explained at the use case level.

</tr>

<tr>
<td>F008</td>
<td>Functional</td>
<td>The solution shall be able to validate against data fields in the database to determine the options available for users for criminal and civil cases. <span style="color: red;">[This is where we identify our rules engine needs and requires operational context in the form of a use case - we already captured some of this.</span></td>

<tr>
<td>F009, F010, F011</td>
<td>General Technical</td>
<td>For all Web Presence interfaces where the defendant may have questions regarding their case or use of the Web Presence interface, provide instant messaging (IM) function to chat with a court system representative. Similar to customary IM chat sessions, chat requests shall be entered into a queue for response by the first available representative with identified anticipated wait time.

<td>Provide new data fields to include: Class Completion Date, Judgment Amount, Judgment Date, Deferral Amount, Defendants Age at Citation, Defendants Age Now, Conviction Date, Disposition Date and performance measure data fields for DACC (list to be provided). <span style="color: red;">[This sounds like a continuation of our use case development activity to define in context how these additional record attributes are used. Without operational context, the vendor is not likely to fully understand the need.]</span></td>

<td></td>
<td>The solution shall implement event logging which will categorize actions on a case into legal actions (e.g., signing up for disposition) and administrative actions (e.g., confirming a defendant's contact information).

<td>F019</td>
<td>Functional</td>
<td>When displaying the fines and costs of a case, the solution's display window will be big enough to see all the fines and costs on a single screen grouped by fines and costs. <span style="color: red;">[This sounds like a Web Presence function associated with the summary of costs. Per our last discussion, we didn't fully decide if we'll provide a case cost summary or deal with each case one at a time.]</span></td>
<td>Must Have</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>F020</td>
<td>General Technical</td>
<td>The solution shall consistently allow the user to hit enter to accept changes. <span style="color: red;">[The W3 standard should adequately address this concern. If I understand correctly, the new AMANDA upgrade includes a normalized, Web screen interface.]</span></td>
<td>Must Have</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>F022</td>
<td>General Technical</td>
<td>The solution shall be Web-based and accessible by any Court work-station. <span style="color: red;">[Recommend removing requirement. New solution proposed in Web-based.]</span></td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>F024</td>
<td>Functional</td>
<td>The solution shall record in the database prosecutor's activities (e.g., updates, document attachments) on the application. <span style="color: red;">[This is a confusing requirement. Possibly redundant to F014. Recommend use case to flush out need.]</span></td>
<td>Must Have</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>F026</td>
<td>General Technical</td>
<td>After logging onto the Web-based solution, a selectable menu shall be available to specify what location, and unit - the user is working from. This information shall be stored so Court Administrator can run metrics against that information. <span style="color: red;">[Recommend changing to: When defendant is using a Web Presence solution, the system shall collect specific information on the Web session (such as Web browser, location, type of device used, IP address, etc.) depending on typical Web session values available. This information is to be used for future analysis of Web user experience and overall value reporting on the usefulness of the Web interface.]</span></td>
