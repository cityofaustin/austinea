<p>Great job everyone! The steam is building in the locomotive... 8^)

<p>Please select the image to the right for a larger view to follow my discussion. For future reference, please refer to this diagram as the Municipal Court <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/default.html#caa">Capability Area Architecture (CAA)</a>. One of the underlying principles of enterprise architecture is to develop a citywide common architecture language to improve cross-department communications. Please follow the link to the city's <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/">Enterprise Architecture Terms and Definitions</a> - you might bookmark this link for future reference.

<p>Based on the model, <b>Develop High Quality Staff</b> appears to be the <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/default.html#capability">capability</a> with the most number of goals; therefore, this is likely your weakest capability. I added <b>Plan Succession</b> as &lt;Part of&gt; relationship to <b>Develop High Quality Staff</b> because <b>Plan Succession</b> is a citywide capability and the relationship will support a future business case for Human Capital Management planning citywide. Manage Court Case is the next capability with the most number of <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/default.html#goal">goals</a>.

<p>Based on model analysis, it appears that the goals <b>Deliver effective customer service</b> and <b>Document Municipal Court processes</b>  contribute to the largest number of capabilities. This is usually a good starting point. If you observe the goal <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/default.html#dependency">dependencies</a>,  you'll observe that <b>Document Municipal Court processes</b> is a critical goal to achieve other important goals. This is not a surprise because we should next explore the processes relevant to <b>Manage Court Case</b> capability specifically toward <b>Develop future needs requirements for case management improvements</b>. This goal depends on <b>Document Municipal Court processes</b> necessary for future needs requirements. In addition, this goal contributes to other goal dependencies and it is needed by contracting to negotiate the future case management system. Your team might begin thinking about &quot;important outcomes&quot; and their related processes that you wish incorporate as improvements to your current case management system capabilities. 

<p>Prior to our next meeting, can someone complete the descriptions into the table below? You can simply reply to this message, edit the TBD elements in the table and send it to me. I'll move the definitions into our model for future reference.
