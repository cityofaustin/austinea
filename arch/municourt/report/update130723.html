<p>Muni Court Architecture Team,

<p>In order to facilitate our discussion regarding the Municipal Court requirements for the AMANDA upgrade, I created a Municipal Court Requirements Model (Excel Spreadsheet) to facilitate requirements maturity and tracking. You can download the spreadsheet by selecting the graphical icon of the spreadsheet. I found the spreadsheet useful in tracking down redundant requirements and consolidating similar requirement needs. The spreadsheet is also useful in identifying future UML Use Case development activities.

<p>During our next meeting, we need to go through the requirements model and determine which ones are mature enough to deliver to CDSC for an early preview of Municipal Courts AMANDA upgrade needs. I'll demonstrate the usefulness of the spreadsheet to filter through our requirements development activity during our next gathering. On delivery, we'll make it clear that our early requirements submission is not a complete representation and that others will follow as they mature. I proposed an input from Municipal Court by 31 July (next Wednesday) and I believe we can deliver something useful by then - in fact, we have 44 mature requirements (Must Have and Expected) and 70 requirements if you include Desired as of today's count. I spoke to Paul Hopingarder, Deputy CIO for Public Safety, who plans to coordinate with the Contracting Officer, Denise Lucas to ensure we're following contract compliance rules. Like Larry the Cable Guy says, &quot;Git-r-done!&quot; 

<p>Respectfully,
