<p>Muni Court Architecture Team,

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Once the online user has verified their identity and has designated their specific case, they are offered legal options, which may include "File for Motion". In response to a "file for Motion" the system will present the appropriate application as an online form. The user completes the form, and provides the apropos electronic signature. Upon completion, the system places the Case in a queue for the Prosecutor to review. They will provide their feedback, and digitally sign the Motion. The System will then place the signed motion into a Judge's queue, who will grant or deny their motion. Upon completion, the user is sent an email indicating the Case, and the Motion they requested, and the Judge's ruling on this judgment. Lastly the electronic case file is added to the Court Clerk's queue for the appropriate reviews and notations. It should be noted the Online user must have previously indicated their plea for the business rule engine to provide this option.</p>

<p>Prior to the message on the sequence diagram is a Reference item [Ref] essentially identifying a preconditional element to the sequence events where the Motion Filer established the File Motion option. A summary of the reference follows:</p>

<p><b>Ref: 1. Select Legal Option</b></p>
<p>The system provides the ability for a Respondent or Defendant to manage all Case Files identified in the case management system using a Web Presence online. The system provides a legally binding form of identification to be persistent throughout the Web session. When a Defendant or Respondent selects a particular Case File of interest from the Web Presence Case File Queue, the system determines the various legal options available to the Defendant or Respondent. The system provides a Municipal Court staff a configurable rules engine to allow Court Staff to modify business rules associated with the options provided to the Defendant or Respondent via Web Presence. The rules engine provides a customizable response based on current Case File attributes such as warrant status, age of Defendant or Respondent, attorney assigned to the case, and plea state (just to name a few) leading to the legal options provided to the Defendant or Respondent. Depending on Municipal Court Staff needs, some responses are non-selectable and grayed out providing indication to Defendant or Respondent why the legal option is not selectable. Because laws frequently change, it's important the legal options are not hard coded into the case management system; rather, the system allows the Court Staff to make appropriate legal option changes using customizable rules filters. Once a Legal Option is selected, the system confirms the Legal Option and it's implication to Respondent or Defendant before storing it with the Case File. </p>
