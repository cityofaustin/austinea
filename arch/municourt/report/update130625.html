<p>Muni Court Team,

<p>We're now moving at full steam in our locomotive and things are moving along very well. When I asked for feedback last week, it was suggested that the architecture process was taking longer than anticipated. However, look through all our past reports and observe how much we've accomplished in just 16 hours! Think about it - just two days of work and we've modeled many future capabilities with unambiguous detail. The models and interface specifications provide great understanding to the vendor on Municipal Court's specific needs. In addition, we've created a reusable framework to develop and evolve interface specifications with reuse potential throughout the process. The reuse identification will reduce your overall costs on a firm-fixed price contract by reducing vendor implementation risk and you'll end up with a better product.

<p>Previously, we discussed how a Web Presence could provide the ability for a Defendant to select their legal option. Last week we pursued the legal option of &quot;Not Guilty&quot;. The following sequence diagram is the triggering process we created a couple of weeks ago to <b><i>Process Not Guilty Plea</i></b> discussed below. During our next meeting, we'll examine other Defendant Plea processes triggered by <b><i>Select Web Presence Legal Option</i></b>.
