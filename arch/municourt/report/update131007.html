<p>Based on our discussions last week, I'd like to share my thoughts on normalizing the way we determine use case functional requirements verses system maintenance or internal functional needs. I'd also like add caution not to dig into the solution space. Logical data modeling can be a useful way to explore business rules needed to define functional needs; however, we should always understand the purpose of building a logical data model. I recommend emphasizing use case development by describing system behavior at the system surface. Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms when roles dialog with systems or artificial entities in conjunction with their environment, which includes other systems as well as the physical environment. Sometimes referred to as pattern of behavior it is the response of the system to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external. When we encounter situations where requirements immerge that are system maintenance or internal functions such as batch processes that lookup missed appearance dates, it's best to capture these functional needs in our requirements spreadsheet (formally referred to as Supplementary Specifications). In theory, even some of these functions have a place in a use case model (e.g., use case - Run Nightly Batch); however, I recommend we place early emphasis on the business/operational processes and capture internal system functions as they surface in our Supplementary Specifications. After all, one purpose of the use case model is to allow teams to establish scope and important outcomes (value) while establishing a description of various stimuli or inputs to satisfy the operational need.</p>

<p>Sorry about all the technical mumbo-jumbo; however, these apparent salient points are crucial to ensure maximum use of our time to describe the future Municipal Court vision. After all, that's what our architecture activity is all about - effectively communicating our business needs to a vendor for a successful implementation. To date, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) approach is considered <a href="http://software-quality.blogspot.com/2006/01/best-practices-for-writing-use-cases.html">Best Practice for Writing Use Cases</a> - properly written, IT vendors understand UML use case models.</p>
