<p><b>Scope: </b>If a payment is taken on a case in collections and the payment needs to be reversed (for example: a bad check or a 
payment applied to the case by mistake) then a 'reversal' record with the reversed payment amount and the new case balance is 
sent over to the collections service.

If the Defendant pays at Court:
<br>&nbsp;<br>
After a case has been sent to collections, when the Defendant makes a payment on the case at the Court, a record is sent to the 
collections system indicating that payment has been made and including the payment amount, payment date and case balance. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
However, if the transaction type is a layout, community service or a judicial order then only the case balance (balance adjustment) 
is sent to the collections system. If the transaction type is BO (bond) then the case management system checks first to see if the bond 
is applied before or after the case has been sent to collections.  If the bond was posted before, the collections vendor does not get credit 
and only a case balance adjustment is sent to the collections system. If the bond was posted after the case was sent, then the case management 
system checks for the Bond dispersed code. If bond is applied, the case management system sends the collection system a payment transaction 
record with the bond amount. Furthermore, when a bond gets posted on a case that has already been sent to collections, the case is then checked 
daily, until the bond is disposed.  If the bond becomes 'disposed' then the case management system ceases checking on the bond dispersal 
and proceeds to process the the disbursed bond amount as a payment or reversal with the collection system.

If the Defendant Pays the Collection vendor:
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When the collections service takes a payment from the Defendant it records the payment and sends a record to the case management 
system that includes the payment amount, payment date, payment type, next payment due date and an extension to pay date (when applicable). If the 
collections service determines through their contact with the Defendant that they have a new mail email address, emial address or phone number 
then they set a flag indicating that the contact information has changed and include the corrected contact info in the file they send to Muni Court.

The case management system creates a collections send file (coordinated with the collections vendor) for all cases added 
that includes the citation information, vehicle information (when applicable), personal identifiers and contact information, 
case starting balance, case balance, total calculated collection fee and status for any case that is being added or is 
already in the collections process. The entire data set is transferred to the collection vendor every time there is an 
update or change to the data. The collection vendor evaluates the entire file and compares the data values for each case 
to what they have on record. Any changes detected are used to add or update their records.
