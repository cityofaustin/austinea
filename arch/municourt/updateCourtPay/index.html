<p><b>Scope: </b>After a case has been sent to collections, when the Defendant makes a payment on the case at the Court, a record is sent to the 
collections system indicating that payment has been made and including the payment amount, payment date and case balance. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
However, if the transaction type is non-monetary (jail credit, community service or a judicial waiver) then only the case balance (balance adjustment) 
is sent to the collections system. If the transaction type is BO (bond) then the case management system checks first to see if the bond 
is applied before or after the case has been sent to collections.  If the bond was posted before, the collections vendor does not get credit 
and only a case balance adjustment is sent to the collections system. If the bond was posted after the case was sent, then the case management 
system checks for the Bond dispersed code. If bond is applied, the case management system sends the collection system a payment transaction 
record with the bond amount. Furthermore, when a bond gets posted on a case that has already been sent to collections, the case is then checked 
daily, until the bond is satisfied.  If the bond becomes 'satisfied' then the case management system ceases checking on the bond dispersal 
and proceeds to process the the disbursed bond amount as a payment or reversal with the collection system.

When a non-surety bond is posted: The Customer (who is either the Defendant or another individual posting a cash bond on the case) submits a request to post a cash bond. 
The Clerk receives the request and begins processing a cash bond on the case (usually for an extension). The clerk retrieves the case file using the 
case number. The Court Clerk enters the bond amount (full cost of the ticket or the amount set on the Judge's order) and uses the current date 
(by default) before printing the bond form to be given to the Customer for completion. The Customer completes and submits the form to the Clerk for 
processing. The Clerk accepts the form and uses the information on it to process the cash bond for the case.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If Customer is not the Defendant on the case then the Clerk submits the demographics provided by the Customer on the bond form and searches the case 
parties for a match. If the Customer is a case party the Clerk sets them as the bond poster. If the Customer is not a case party on the case, the 
Clerk adds the customer as an additional case party on the case and sets them as the bond poster.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Clerk requests payment for the bond from the Customer. The Customer remits the requested payment to the Court Clerk. The Clerk processes the 
remittance for the cash bond by setting the bond type ('CB'), payment type and transaction type ('BO'). The Clerk scans and attaches the completed bond 
form to the case.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If the Defendant missed an appearance with the prosecutor the Clerk adds an action to the case indicating that with one of the codes: TRAD, CMAD, ENAD
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The case management system presents the appropriate docket schedule to the Clerk depending upon information submitted in the bond request. The Court 
Clerk reviews the docket schedule and suggests the first court appearance date available to the Customer. If the Customer prefers a different date 
on the docket schedule they present that preference to the Clerk. The Clerk generates the Notice To appear document. The clerk gives a copy of the 
completed bond form, a receipt for the bond payment and the Notice To Appear to the Customer.

The case management system compares the date the bond was posted with the date the case was sent to collections. If the bond was

The case management system calculates the collection fee on the case. As required by law, the system must recalculate the collection fee as 
partial jail time credit or community service is applied to a case in third party collections within the case management system. The fee will 
be recalculated on the reduced balance on the case. The new case balance will be sent to the collection agency along with the recalculated fee.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The system is required to log a case note indicating a collection fee was added, reduced or removed from collections. If reduced, the system is required 
to log the reduced amount, date and time. The system is required to maintain a reference of the original collection fee amount as well.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If a case that does not have a plea is assigned to collections, then when there is a guilty plea and the judge imposes a lower fine than the default 
fine amount then the collection fee is recalculated.
Track starting balance, total fees disbursed on the case and all transactions and recalculations to resolve disputes with the vendor.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Note: always disburse the collection fee last.

The case management system creates a collections send file (coordinated with the collections vendor) for all cases added 
that includes the citation information, vehicle information (when applicable), personal identifiers and contact information, 
case starting balance, case balance, total calculated collection fee and status for any case that is being added or is 
already in the collections process. The entire data set is transferred to the collection vendor every time there is an 
update or change to the data. The collection vendor evaluates the entire file and compares the data values for each case 
to what they have on record. Any changes detected are used to add or update their records.
