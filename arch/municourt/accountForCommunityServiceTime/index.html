<p><b>Scope: </b>The Defendant submits proof of community Service hours. The Clerk locates the community Service Plan, and applies the hours reported to the Community Service Plan. 
The Clerk attaches the community service document to the community Service Plan. The upload creates a unique reference number for tracking the "Receipt" document. 
The System offers the clerk the option to either print or email the Receipt to the Defendant/Attorney/etc., and attaches a Receipt to the community Service Plan and associated credited case, for future printing. 
The system updates each case affected with a case specific credit for the associated community Service and records the associated reference document number of the scanned community service hours. 
Both Dollars and Hour totals are reflected at the Case level. The system adjusts the balances against the plan, and generates a receipt for the Defendant. 
The Community Service Plan update is added to the Clerk queue for later confirmation. The Clerk contacts the Community Service Provider to verify the 
hours submitted.

The User is presented a list of fields to provide information for the system to locate the Person ID (PID) for a Defendant. 
The fields used for the PID search include, but are not limited to, Partial First name, Partial Last Name, First Name, Last Name, 
Address, Driver's License Number, Plate Number, Date of Birth, Telephone number. The System conducts a search and provides a list of 
matching Defendants from which the User can choose. 
If the case management system is performing the search for the defendant PID (by case number) then the system searches for the PID 
associated with the defendant case party listed on the case.

The User specifies the Personal ID (PID) for the defendant, or selects the name of a defendant which provides the PID to be used for 
subsequent actions. The system returns a designator indicating the number of Community Service Case plans the Defendant has. If at 
least one exists, the system returns a list of plans established. The list of Plans also includes a list of the associated cases for 
each plan. Additionally the system returns a list of ALL cases associate with the PID not currently assigned to a Community Service Plan.

The Clerk selects the Community Plan listed which is associated with the case whose hours are to be credited. The System prompts 
the Clerk to provide documentation/proof to be scanned. Once the document is scanned, the Clerk verifies the scan is acceptable, 
and is offered the opportunity to rescan the document should the image not be satisfactory. Once acceptable, the system generates 
a Receipt which should be stored and printable. The Receipt is locatable and printable by both the case and the community service 
plan to which the case belongs.
