<h1>The Value of a Service Model</h1>

<p>Understanding the capabilities required by our directorate provides a high-level overview of our services and a useful exercise to take a step back and focus on what the key elements of our business are. We can avoid getting bogged down in the details of 'how' things happen and concentrate on 'what' does (or needs to) happen. Once complete, it is possible to identify key capabilities, for example, the ones that differentiate our business and use this information to ensure focus on the areas of importance in our business, whether this is in defining new projects or ensuring business as usual delivers appropriately.

<p>We use Capabilities to model the services that a business or enterprise offers or requires. These capabilities are modeled in the Conceptual layer and represent what the business does (or needs to do) in order to fulfil its objectives and responsibilities. Capabilities are the top layer of the business architecture and they belong to the CTM domain governing principles. CTM roles (i.e., an individual or team) and process realize capabilities. The Capability is, therefore, at a higher level than a process and is in the conceptual layer. It represents a conceptual service that a group of processes and people, supported by the relevant application, information and underlying technology, perform. The capability represents the what, whereas the process and people represent the how.

<h1>Service Model Timing</h1>

<p>There are 14 effective work performance weeks prior to my retirement on 18 Aug. There is ample time to complete the CTM Service Model - assuming relevant domains provide adequate resources and commitment. Be aware, the CTM service model may not align with current organizational structure - the service model aligns to important outcomes. After completion, the model is useful to explore organizational considerations or possibly competency relationships.

<h1>Resource Requirements</h1>

<p>EA has no administrative staff; therefore, we're going to require administrative assistance to organize and schedule domain experts and meeting space. For example, assigning a project coordinator or project manager can assist greatly - this person should be familiar with EA support needs and processes.

<p>Each CTM domain provides leadership representation with decision-authority and expertise representing the services of their assigned domain. EA governs the process and domain experts govern the content. Attendance is limited to no more than eight subject matter experts. Here's a research paper indicating the decision-making limit is seven - <a href="http://sheilamargolis.com/2011/01/24/what-is-the-optimal-group-size-for-decision-making/">What is the optimal group size for decision-making?</a> This report indicates five-seven as optimal, but I've been successful with eight due to the facilitation nature of our meetings.

<h1>Meeting Frequency</h1>

<p>We'll meet once per week (or as needed) for 1.5 hours until approved by leadership. I recognize we may need to skip a week or two in order to bring the correct resources together. In addition, for every 1.5-hour meeting, there are five to ten hours of architecting to normalize the service model to proper form (i.e., capability class definition). I can't say the exact number of meetings because it varies depending on the size and complexity of the service grouping. For example, I'd expect Enterprise Infrastructure Management (EIM) to take longer than Business Applications and the Project Management Office. For some domains, this work has already begun and requires much less effort.

<h1>Anticipated Activities</h1>

<p>We start with a stakeholder model. This model treats the organization as a black box and identifies business stakeholder roles receiving value (usually in the form of a tangible result of value) from the service provider. Services are in the form of capabilities that represent the people, processes and technology delivering value for a specific purpose. The quality of being capable; to have the capacity or ability to do something, achieve specific outcomes, effects or declared goals and objectives. Process in itself does not represent capability; rather capabilities (services) are containers of like processes. The service model is in a verb/noun form, which provides clarity of the action performed on the object (the thing of value). This approach has a proven record of accomplishment in quality management circles such as value-chain and total quality management. Just to show you this isn't a Rob Byrd thing, see <a href="http://www.enterprise-architecture.org/business-architecture-tutorials/82-business-cap-process-naming">Business Architecture Tutorials</a> - also see <a href="http://www.accelare.com/blog/are-capabilities-nouns-or-verb-nouns">Are Capabilities Nouns or Verb-Nouns?</a> I've noticed a great deal of resistance from our folks to deviate from our traditional ways such as Asset Management rather than Manage Assets, which is the proper convention widely adopted by architects and quality management circles. As an example, see <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/information-technology/services">Information Technology Services</a>. These service-naming conventions do not align to industry standard verb/noun capability (service) naming conventions.

<h1>Service Model Status</h1>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Enterprise Infrastructure Management (EIM)</h2>

<p>EA worked with EIM leadership to develop a stakeholder model and found service patterns from previous ITIL service models. In addition, Mike LaMarre worked extensively with EA to refine the model. The model still requires vetting with current domain experts to include service capability definition review and dependency associations. I anticipate two or three meetings to maturity.

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Business Applications Services</h2>

<p>This is likely the most mature model. EA met with EBS domain experts and flushed out a comprehensive stakeholder service definition. However, refinement is likely required. I anticipate two more meetings are required.

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Project Management Office</h2>

<p>Not started...

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Chief Information Security Office</h2>

<p>Much work accomplished when function belong to EIM. Requires review - Kevin Williams likely to make improvements.

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">IT Business Continuity</h2>

<p>Not started...

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Enterprise Architecture</h2>

<p>Complete...

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Financial Management</h2>

<p>Not started...

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Public Safety</h2>

<p>There's not adequate time to accomplish a Public Safety service model - for example, CTECC itself is likely a large service model due to its extensive stakeholder community. However, the EIM service model is a great starting point to explore capabilities that make sense to explore shared opportunities. If the CTM service model work ends with successful value, I'd be willing to discuss returning as a consultant to further refine the Public Safety service model and analyze opportunities of shared value. Alternately, Aaron Brown can assist in this endeavor - I plan to mentor Aaron further during this service model activity.

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Wireless</h2>

<p>Complete - requires review...
