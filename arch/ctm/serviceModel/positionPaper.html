<h1>The Value of a Service Model</h1>

<ul>
<li>Provides a high-level overview of our services and a useful exercise to take a step back and focus on what the key elements of our business are. Avoid getting bogged down in the details of 'how' things happen and concentrate on 'what' does (or needs to) happen
<li>Makes possible to identify key capabilities, for example, the ones that differentiate our business and use this information to ensure focus on the areas of importance in our business, whether this is in defining new projects or ensuring business as usual delivers appropriately
<li>Modeled Capabilities in the Conceptual layer and represent what the business does (or needs to do) in order to fulfil its objectives and responsibilities
<li>CTM roles and process realize capabilities. The Capability is, therefore, at a higher level than a process and is in the conceptual layer
<li>The capability represents the what, whereas the process and people represent the how
</ul>

<h1>Service Model Timing</h1>
<ul>
<li>There are 14 effective work performance weeks prior to my retirement on 18 Aug. Ample time to complete the CTM Service Model - assuming relevant domains provide adequate resources and commitment
</ul>

<h1>Resource Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>EA is going to require administrative assistance to organize and schedule domain experts and meeting space
<li>Each CTM domain provides leadership representation with decision-authority and expertise representing the services of their assigned domain
<li>EA governs the process and domain experts govern the content
<li>Attendance is limited to no more than eight subject matter experts
</ul>


<h1>Meeting Frequency</h1>
<ul>
<li>Meet once per week (or as needed) for 1.5 hours until approved by leadership
<li>For some domains, this work has already begun and requires much less effort
</ul>


<h1>Anticipated Activities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start with a stakeholder model - evolve to services in the form of capabilities
</ul>

<h1>Service Model Status</h1>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Enterprise Infrastructure Management (EIM)</h2>
<ul>
<li>EA worked with EIM leadership to develop a stakeholder model and found service patterns from previous ITIL service models
<li>Mike LaMarre worked extensively with EA to refine the model. The model still requires vetting with current domain experts to include service capability definition review and dependency associations
</ul>


<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Business Applications Services</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is likely the most mature model. However, refinement is likely required
</ul>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Project Management Office</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not started...
</ul>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Chief Information Security Office</h2>
<ul>
<li>Much work accomplished when function belong to EIM. Requires review
</ul>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">IT Business Continuity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not started...
</ul>

<H2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Enterprise Architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete...
</ul>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Financial Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not started...
</ul>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Public Safety</h2>
<ul>
<li>There's not adequate time to accomplish a Public Safety service model - for example, CTECC itself is likely a large service model due to its extensive stakeholder community
<li>The EIM service model is a great starting point to explore capabilities that make sense to explore shared opportunities
</ul>

<h2 style="text-indent: 0.2in;">Wireless</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete - requires review...
</ul>
