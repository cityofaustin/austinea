<td style="font-weight: bold; background: lightgray;">Manage Incidents and Requests</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An employee or citizen submits an Incident or a Request via phone, Web, email, fax, walk in, etc. A Front Line Agent uses the system to either review Incident/Request or create Incident/Request submission and indicate if the submittal is an Incident or a Request. Ideally, Requests for fulfillment arrive through an employee or citizen selection from a service catalog. The Front Line Agent ensures details of the Incident/Request are clear and accurate, which may require the Front Line Agent to contact the Submitter for further details. Incidents are typically technical desk tickets for system mal functions and Requests are typically service desk tickets for new accounts, software requests, distribution lists, etc. For Incident/Request, the Front Line Agent further refines the details and decides if able to resolve. For Incident/Request, all designated users may use the system for knowledge base search, search previous/current ticket history, enter or refine Incident/Request, provide ticket status indication, set priority, categorize, document work accomplished or resolution, enter time of activity, attach supporting documents, or escalate. Knowledge base success factors use the system to close the ticket automatically. For difficult Incident/Request, etc., the Front Line Agent uses the system to escalate the ticket to Second Level Support, Field Technician, or other IT organizations. If the ticket remains unresolved, then the Second Level Support (may include Field Technician, or other IT organizations) use the system to assign to a Third Level Support, which carries the ticket until resolved. Designated users may use the system to predefine workflows or create subtasks (work order) - e.g., child task for identified additional work activities - including sequenced events. The system uses a master ticket (white board) for which to attach multiple tickets of the same Incident for follow up (used for white board, outages, crisis management and information management). The system provides the ability to run queries to evaluate or review workload, add additional contacts to directory list, find contact history, etc.</td>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold; background: lightgray;">Use Knowledge Base</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The system integrates the Incident/Request application to include self-service use of knowledge management. The Front Line Agent uses the system to search the knowledge base – the correct selected knowledge base article automatically populates the Incident ticket using the category/subject and summary of the knowledge base (KB) article. The system requires extensive KB article search abilities to include body of article search if needed. The ticket provides link to the full KB article and closes ticket with KB attribute indication. If a KB article does not exist for a particular Incident, the system creates a KB document for completion by the Incident resolving party. The system provides report indication on status of any incomplete KB documents and responsible party. A KB document includes, but not limited to, created by, content author (subject matter expert), format author, and date created. KB articles are started by template types such as how to, problem, error message, reference, or decision tree and designated audiences (e.g., user, customer service desk, work group, internal work group, etc.). Selected KB fields require internal visibility only – not visible to the self-serving public. The system facilitates email of KB articles. When a self-serving employee or citizen searches and finds a useful KB article, the system indicates by opening and closing a ticket of a specific KB use. The system imports existing KB articles from other KB systems.</td>

<td style="font-weight: bold; background: lightgray;">Manage Changing Assets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Change Coordinator receives change requests from the system for various service needs. Change requests are triggered by the system from four sources to include incident management, problem management, release management and continuity management. The system aids the Change Coordinator in change planning by documenting the risk and impact analysis in order to minimize the risk of failure and impact on the customer(s). When the Change Coordinator is unable to accomplish a selected risk item, the Change Coordinator uses the system to assign the most appropriate specialist within the change coordinator's group, or to another group. The Change Manager uses the system to approve selected risk mitigated change requests. Following the change plan, Specialists implement infrastructure, application, and/or emergency changes according to the plan. The Change Coordinator uses the system to register the change and ensures update to the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and the Capacity Management information as needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold; background: lightgray;">Manage Problem</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Problem Management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems. The primary objectives of problem management are to prevent problems and resulting incidents from happening, to eliminate recurring incidents, and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) defines a problem as the cause of one or more incidents. The Problem Coordinator uses support request information to identify problems in the service(s) he/she is responsible. The Problem Coordinator's most important tool for identifying problems are the search and reporting functionality of the service management application. A Specialist can also draw the attention of a Problem Coordinator to certain support requests that, in the opinion of the Specialist, represent a problem. After the identification of a problem, the Problem Coordinator registers the problem with the system. The Problem Coordinator subsequently uses the system to select the appropriate severity level and links the support requests caused by the problem. The Problem Coordinator then uses the system to assign the problem to the most appropriate Specialist (in terms of skills, availability and access rights) for analysis. The service desk is automatically informed via the system that a new problem has been identified after the problem has been saved in the system for subsequent service request tagging. When the Problem Coordinator finds support requests that have not yet been linked to a problem, but which were caused by a previously identified problem, Problem Coordinator uses the system to links these support requests to the problem.</td>
