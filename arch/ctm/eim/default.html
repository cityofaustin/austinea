<p>For Enterprise Infrastructure Management (EIM), Enterprise Architecture (EA) took a different approach due to the complex nature of the services offered. The top-down, bottom-up method capitalized on previous Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) work. Through collaboration with EIM leadership, we determined that previous identified ITSM services were actually processes, rather than services (i.e., capabilities). By grouping similar processes (see figure <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ctm/eim/serviceWithProcess.jpg" target="_blank">Service with Process</a>), the EIM team identified process <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/#type" target="_blank">types</a> referred as <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/#capability" target="_blank">capability</a>. Capability represents people, processes and technology delivering value for a specific purpose. The quality of being capable; to have the capacity or ability to do something, achieve specific outcomes, effects or declared goals and objectives. At the highest level, the <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ctm/eim/serviceModel.jpg" target="_blank">Customer Facing Service Model</a> captures the CTM value proposition - i.e., services delivering direct value to the CTM <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/#environment" target="_blank">environment</a> (i.e., direct interface with stakeholders).

<p>Due to the complex nature of IT infrastructure management, the dependency and composition understanding provides many benefits. First, the architecture provides leadership decision-making from an outcome-focused viewpoint, which can lead to infrastructure management organizational considerations - organizationally, it's important to ensure services are not fragmented under multiple leadership responsibilities. Compositional &laquo;Part of&raquo; and &laquo;Depends&nbsp;On&raquo; relationships provide further organizational understanding. Second, process grouping of similar type allows competency determination - the needed skill or ability to do something successfully or efficiently. Finally, the service model allows people in the organization to understand how their work contributes to the overall business outcome - a key principle requested by the IT staff. There are other contributory factors such as goals, objects and relationship to stakeholder outcomes, which lead to improved investment decisions. In essence, a service architecture adds a visible element to share ideas, discuss improvements, reduce misunderstanding and increase overall community communications.

<p>To assist the IT staff in understanding their role with CTM services, EA created the following <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ctm/eim/serviceWithProcess.jpg" target="_blank">Service Model with Process</a> (use case). The green circle with blue pentagon indicates a process - the collection of processes exercise the capability (i.e., type of process).
