<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Office of the CISO<br />Capability Area Architecture</p>

<p>After some dialog with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), EA pursued an alternative approach to derive the Office of the CISO service definition. Rather than identifying stakeholder value, EA analyzed the Information Security Status Assessment report and extracted relevant goals and objectives. Using these elements, EA took a bottom-up approach to derive the Office of the CISO defined capability. EA tested the draft definition against the report's status assessment and concluded a valid service definition. EA vetted the definition with the CISO. Because service definitions don't typically include reference to stakeholders, this still represents a valid service description.

<p>The model does not define &laquo;Objectives&raquo; in measurable terms; however, we concluded this as beyond the scope of the current service model work anda good next step activity. Note that the indicated processes are incomplete - there are likely more. However, this approach ensured the capture of assigned responsibility of previously identified Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) processes. Some previously identified ITSM processes were actually identified &laquo;Goals&raquo; and &laquo;Objectives&raquo; and indicated accordingly by removal from the model.
