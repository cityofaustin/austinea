<tr>
<td>Provide Data Services</td>
<td>Using data modeling and analysis tools, perform reference and master data management to efficiently integrate city data (both structure and unstructured), deliver open public data when appropriate and enable business intelligence through data marts and data warehousing.</td>

<tr>
<td>Provide Application Support Services</td>
<td>Support business needs using common enterprise applications and development tools for building applications unique to departments. The application is intended to solve enterprise-wide problems not just individual departmental problems. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise's productivity and efficiency by providing business logic support functionality. Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of complex data and the support or automate business processes with that data. Enterprise applications perform business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one user at a time.</td>

Highly knowledgeable IT staff coordinates proper technology solution (i.e., contracting, security, integration standards, etc.).
