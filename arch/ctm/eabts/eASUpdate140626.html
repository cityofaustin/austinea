<p style="color: gray; font-size: 8pt; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Enterprise Architecture <i>- aligning IT services with business needs</i></p>
<!-- Main Body -->
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; background-color: #ffffff;" width="650" align="center"><tr><td>

<p>Let's first review the purpose (i.e., reason) we're doing this architecture, which is founded on the principle of collective reasoning. We're actively aligning our IT services to the business needs of the enterprise. The business people went through a similar exercise where they told their business story, which led to the recognition of Common IT Capabilities or Essential IT Capabilities. In our exercise, we mapped our Enterprise Application Services (EAS) to the Essential IT Capability and told our IT story in the form of a roadmap (I'll explain later) to evolve to an Essential IT Capability center-of-excellence (COE). 

<p>I believe we've successfully matured our Enterprise Application Services (EAS) capability model (<a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASServiceModel2.jpg">see figure below</a>) - albeit, we're not done yet. However, we have enough collective knowledge to tell a very compelling story. The description of each goal is listed in the <a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#custom">table below</a>. There are other goals not shown in the figure because this view focused on shared goals - the purpose of the exercise. This doesn't mean these goals aren't important; rather, they need to be addressed separately. Later, I'll provide reports for each service area. However, we still need to establish measureable objects to determine how we measure goal maturity.</p>

<p>We don't require objective measures for all our goals - just the key goals that I'll discuss. If you look at the diagram, you'll observe a large number of concentrations on <a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#2">Maintain technical concurrency</a>, which makes this an important goal to achieve. However, this goal depends on the following goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#1">Improve customer engagement</a>
<li><a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#3">Improve license compliance management</a>
<li><a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#4">Separate operational from development activities</a>
<li><a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#6">Perform vendor relationship management</a>
<li><a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#5">dependency: Obtain managed services</a>
</ul>

<p class="lbl">Note: select to view definition...</p>

<p>These dependency relationships imply equal importance and should be our initial focus of attention. For example, by improving customer engagement, we <a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#7">enable customer self-service</a> and <a href="/austinea/arch/ctm/eas/eASUpdate140626.html#8">empower departments to manage department specific IT needs</a>.  

</p>From a <i>Service Manager</i> viewpoint, we're disclosing something significant. We don't need our Service Manager to manage Essential IT Capability; rather, our Service Manager shepherds our newly established goals (i.e., following our roadmap) with emphasis on Essential IT Capabilities - the dependency relationships reveal the shared service nature (i.e., applications, data, GIS), which makes a one-to-one service management relationship with Essential IT Capabilities ineffective. Accomplishing these goals inherently achieves the desired Essential IT Capability because our goals align service delivery to these capabilities. Our roadmap should include a strategy to accomplish our stated goals. This is why establishing objectives is important - it is the collective reasoning of execution.</p>
