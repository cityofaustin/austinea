<p>The following graphical view depicts the CTM Support Service Group's <a href="/austinea/definition/#environment" target="_blank">environment</a> and important stakeholders. The description captures deliverables (i.e., information elements) important to the stakeholders also considered important outcomes representing value. This viewpoint is an important step to identify services (<a href="/austinea/definition/#capability">capabilities</a>) when stakeholders receive similar value. Service descriptions don't typically describe stakeholders and their role - this occurs later in the architecture development process. This viewpoint is not architecturally significant; however, it's useful as a brainstorming tool to maintain group focus on the services rendered in the form of important information elements as <a href="/austinea/definition/#object" target="_blank">objects</a>. The architect uses this information to identify patterns useful in service description.</p>

<p>Through examination and analysis, the enterprise architect looks for information element patterns to synthesize and derive the service and its description. To finalize the process, the enterprise architect vets the descriptions with the service group to make corrections, adjustments or add clarity.
