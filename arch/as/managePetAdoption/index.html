<p><b>Scope: </b>The Citizen uses online resources (websites, social media, shelter visit, etc.) to research and locate animals of their liking. Once an animal is desired, the Citizen contacts Customer Service and indicates interest. Customer Service will check to determine if the Citizen has prior history, and will ask them several questions related to animal handling and adoption. If any concerns are raised with the quality of the Citizen, a Senior Staff member will vet the Citizen to clarify the adoption issues. If the Citizen is qualified to adopt, Customer Service will have them sign a pet agreement, and will check to see if the pet can be released. If the animal has undergone recent surgery, or has a physical injury, the Vet may determine the animal cannot be released until a later date. If there is no hold on releasing the animal, the Veterinary Technician will request general medical information about the animal be released to the Citizen. Customer Service prints the paperwork and has the Citizen sign the medical summary, indicating they understand the current and past medical history of the animal prior to adoption. Customer Service uses the system to annotate the PersonInfo indicating the signature of the documents and directs the Citizen to the Cashier to pay adoption fees. The Cashier receives payment and provides the Citizen a receipt. Customer Service contacts Animal Care to bring the animal to the Citizen. Once delivered, Customer Service, once again uses the system to annotate the delivery of the animal to the Citizen.

<td>Customer Service/Foster Coordinator/Other users will access the system and add or update person and animal info. They will include information like owner, owner address, pet name, pet breed, pet sex, pet microchip info, rabies certificate information, as well as other important information. If the animal or person is already in the system, Customer Service uses the system to update the information. In the case of Trappers, add the date they signed the Standards of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure. In the event of Volunteer Applicant for Trappers, the Outreach Education Team will access the system and provide information from the TrapperApplication to create a PersonInfo record for the Applicant (including verification date and time for the signing of the Standard of Conduct, and the Standard Operating Procedure), if one does not already exist. If a PersonInfo record exists, the Outreach Education Team will update the information as necessary based on the Applicant's information. 
For spay/neuter, the user modifies the sex of the animal from M/F (male/female) to S/N (spay/neuter), and records the date of surgery, date processed, vet clinic ID (the system maintains a list of all vet clinics on record within the area). Foster Coordinators/Rescue Coordinators create PersonInfo records for Citizens acting/assisting with foster care, and annotate AnimalInfo Records with information indicating Foster Care Providers who have taken ownership of the animals.</td>

NOTE: It is desirable for the POINT OF SALE system to integrate with AIMs to record the money receipt.
