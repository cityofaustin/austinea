<p><b>Scope: </b> The Animal Source (a Citizen, Field Officer, or Animal Owner) brings an animal to the City of Austin Animal Shelter, and the standard "Intake Animal" process is followed to check the animal's health, provide vaccines, and check for a microchip. Following intake, the animal's information is sent to the StrayMapper website to display the location at which the animal was found. If the animal's owner is not readily available, and the Animal Source is willing to distribute fliers, Customer Service will create "found fliers" for the Animal Source to distribute. If the animal is found to have a microchip, Customer Service will check with the respective microchip's company roster to determine if the owner can be located. If the Animal Source knows the owner, Customer Service takes the owner information. Once the owner information is determined, Customer Service will contact the owner and request they come claim their animal. If the animal's owner comes to pick up the animal, they are required to provide proof of ownership for the animal, and pay any fees accrued prior to the animal's release. If an animal's owner cannot be located within 72 hours, the animal is made available for general adoption with the public.

<td>Customer Service/Foster Coordinator/Other users will access the system and add or update person and animal info. They will include information like owner, owner address, pet name, pet breed, pet sex, pet microchip info, rabies certificate information, as well as other important information. If the animal or person is already in the system, Customer Service uses the system to update the information. In the case of Trappers, add the date they signed the Standards of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure. In the event of Volunteer Applicant for Trappers, the Outreach Education Team will access the system and provide information from the TrapperApplication to create a PersonInfo record for the Applicant (including verification date and time for the signing of the Standard of Conduct, and the Standard Operating Procedure), if one does not already exist. If a PersonInfo record exists, the Outreach Education Team will update the information as necessary based on the Applicant's information. 
For spay/neuter, the user modifies the sex of the animal from M/F (male/female) to S/N (spay/neuter), and records the date of surgery, date processed, vet clinic ID (the system maintains a list of all vet clinics on record within the area).
Foster Coordinators/Rescue Coordinators create PersonInfo records for Citizens acting/assisting with foster care, and annotate AnimalInfo Records with information indicating Foster Care Providers who have taken ownership of the animals.</td>

NOTE: It would be desired to have the system automatically know the microchip vendor based on code and interface with that company. Currently all microchip companies require phone calls. The microchip company will call the person registered and this may be the owner. It may not be if the ownership has been transferred after registration. This may lead to calls to Veterinarians or other animal shelters or animal welfare agencies in an attempt to find the real owner of the animal. If an email is provided, then an email will be sent to the owner.</td>

This includes: date, time, amount, type of payment (cash, check or credit), the animal for which the payment is made (the animalID) and the PersonID. NOTE: It is desirable for the POINT OF SALE system to integrate with AIMs to record the money receipt. On reclaim, fees may be waived if the animal is already spayed/neutered and microchipped, or if the owner is expedient in their attempt to reclaim.</td>
