<p><b>Scope: </b>An animal is identified as needing to be housed in a kennel. This is either through a request from Customer Service or via two reports that are run daily: the Move List, and the Surgery List. If the facility is at capacity, the animal is moved to a temporary kennel, and an attempt is made to place the animal at the Town Lake Animal Center or with a Rescue or Foster Organization. If a kennel is available, and the animal is injured, it will be moved to a non-public medical ward. If a kennel is available, the animal is a stray and has no illness, it's moved to a public kennel. If a kennel is available, the animal is a stray and is unwell, it's moved to a public kennel isolation kennel. If a kennel is available, and the animal has bitten someone, it's moved to a non-public quarantine kennel. If a kennel is available, the animal owner has been identified, the animal is moved to a non-public kennel. Once the animal is placed into a kennel, Animal Care uses the system to generate a kennel card, and update the animal information to indicate the new location of the animal. As a final step, once an animal has been moved from a kennel, Animal Care will clean the vacated kennel location if possible.

<td>Customer Service/Foster Coordinator/Other users will access the system and add or update person and animal info. They will include information like Animal Owner, owner address, pet name, pet breed, pet sex, pet microchip info, rabies certificate information, as well as other important information. If the animal or person is already in the system, Customer Service uses the system to update the information. In the case of Trappers, add the date they signed the Standards of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure. In the event of volunteer applicant for Trappers, the Outreach Education Team will access the system and provide information from the TrapperApplication to create a PersonInfo record for the Applicant (including verification date and time for the signing of the Standard of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure), if one does not already exist. If a PersonInfo record exists, the Outreach Education Team will update the information as necessary based on the Applicant’s information. For spay/neuter, the user modifies the sex of the animal from M/F (male/female) to S/N (spay/neuter), and records the date of surgery, date processed and vet clinic ID (the system maintains a list of all vet clinics on record within the area).
Foster Coordinators/Rescue Coordinators create PersonInfo records for Citizens acting/assisting with foster care, and annotate AnimalInfo records with information indicating Foster Care Providers who have taken ownership of the animals.</td>
