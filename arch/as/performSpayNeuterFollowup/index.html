<p><b>Scope: </b>Animal is adopted via the "Manage Pet Adoption" process, during which it is established if the animal needs sterilization. The Adoptee signs a Spay and Neuter Agreement when taking possession of the animal. The Admin Personnel uses the system to record this commitment. Weekly, Admin Personnel uses the system to generate reminder cards to be sent to Adoptees, and uses the system to generate a "weekly call list." The Admin Personnel attempts to contact each delinquent Adoptee, requesting proof of sterilization be provided. Based on the information/animal disposition communicated, the Admin Personnel will contact the Vet referenced to confirm the surgery. Monthly, the Admin Personnel uses the system to generate a report of all people who are delinquent by 30 days or more. The Admin Personnel constructs a certified letter to each delinquent Adoptee providing notification of the issuance of a citation after 10 days. The Admin Personnel invokes the Issue Citation process for all non-compliant Adoptees 10 business days after the certified letter has been sent. If the Adoptee provides verifiable confirmation of the animal being sterilized, it is recorded within the system, and the Manage Deposits process is used to either provide refund of deposits made during adoption or change the deposit to a donation. During this process, the Admin Personnel will record all attempts to contact Adoptee and all their conversations within the system.

<td>Customer Service/Foster Coordinator/Other users will access the system and add or update person and animal info. They will include information like Animal Owner, owner address, pet name, pet breed, pet sex, pet microchip info, rabies certificate information, as well as other important information. If the animal or person is already in the system, Customer Service uses the system to update the information. In the case of Trappers, add the date they signed the Standards of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure. In the event of volunteer applicant for Trappers, the Outreach Education Team will access the system and provide information from the TrapperApplication to create a PersonInfo record for the Applicant (including verification date and time for the signing of the Standard of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure), if one does not already exist. If a PersonInfo record exists, the Outreach Education Team will update the information as necessary based on the Applicant's information. For spay/neuter, the user modifies the sex of the animal from M/F (male/female) to S/N (spay/neuter), and records the date of surgery, date processed and vet clinic ID (the system maintains a list of all vet clinics on record within the area).
Foster Coordinators/Rescue Coordinators create PersonInfo records for Citizens acting/assisting with foster care, and annotate AnimalInfo records with information indicating Foster Care Providers who have taken ownership of the animals.</td>
