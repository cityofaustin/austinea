<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Outreach Education Team determines the dates and locations of the Rabies Clinics for the upcoming year. They vet locations, and talk with potential sights and ultimately, with the coordination of the marketing team decide upon the specifics (locations, dates and times.)
Once determine, the Outreach Education Team accesses the system and records the dates and times of the event. 
When one of the Rabies clinics approaches, the Outreach Education Team will access Givepulse to advertise for volunteers to assist with making fliers, distributing fliers, and working the Rabies clinic event. 
As volunteers are located, they access the system and assign themselves or their applicable staff to a list maintained by the system specifically for organizing public events. The System provides a mechanism by which the Outreach Education Team can solicited for assistance for internal resources. Through this mechanism, the Outreach Education Team locates Supervisors, internal staff, Vet Technicians as well as Veterinary staff for the clinic.  The system captures Veterinary information, licensing. 
Additionally Veterinary Services will access the system and provide vaccine lot information to be used during the Rabies Clinic, and the Outreach Education Team using the system prints the associated labels for the Rabies Certificates. 
The Outreach Education Team will contact Emancipet to coordinate their services during the Rabies clinic. 
The Outreach Education Team then prepares a map of the grounds at which the Rabies clinic will be held, and uses the system to scan, upload and attach the image to the system’s event tracking area (in this manner, all team members can see, reference, and print the map as needed.
Once the clinic is complete, the Outreach Education Team will contact Emancipet and gather information about the number of animals Emancipet provided services, and how many were provided vouchers or references for future services.  The Outreach Education Team accesses the system and adds the Emancipet information to the event tracking. 
The Outreach Education Team uses the system to create a standardized report of the Rabies event, and distributes the report to all concerned persons (modifiable by the Outreach Education Team.)
Customer Service accesses the system and creates Animal Info and Person Info as needed (or updates existing information as necessary) for information gathered during the Rabies clinic related to people and their animals. Note: it is desirable for this information to located/modifiable via a mobile device (like an iPad or mobile phone) at the time of the Rabies Clinic, making the Customer Service interaction unnecessary in the future. 
Additionally, they system will provide web access to the event information, should any employee need to access any of the information gathered in preparation for the event.  </p>
