<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Animal Services receives a complaint. This can be via the 311 Call Center, a legal entity (APD or Travis county), or a field officer. If received via the 311 center, the complaint is recorded and forwarded to the Animal Services System. Legal entities like APD and Travis county call and talk to the Animal Services dispatcher, who then adds the complaint to the appropriate Animal Services Queue. Field Officers can access the system remotely from a mobile device and can add reports of animal issues they encounter while on duty. The Field officer assigned, based on the district to which the complaint belongs and to which district the Field Officer is assigned.
The Field officer accesses the system and "begins" an activity. The Field Officer specifies the activity number (a unique number assigned to all complaints), and the Activity Type (any of a number of activities the Field Officer can do) about to begin. The system records the date and time associated with the complaint and activity. The System provides a mechanism for starting, stopping, and completing activities, as well as provides reports for detailing the activities associated with an activity no. The Field officer evaluates the complaint and takes appropriate action. Non-Owner Animals are impounded, relocated, delivered to a Vet, an Emergency Clinic, or delivered to Wildlife Rescue. Animals whose Owner can be determined are either contained in a place accessible to the owner, or are brought to the Animal Services Intake. Depending on the circumstances and City policy, the owner is issued a requirement to complete Responsible Pet Owner Training (RPO) or may be issued a citation.  Owners who do not complete the RPO as dictated are issued a citation. Citations require the Field Officer to go the court for which the citation has been drawn, and deliver a copy. Once completed, the Field officer accesses the system and "ends" the activity. The Field Officer specifies the activity number (a unique number assigned to all complaints), and the Activity Type (any of a number of activities the Field Officer can do) to end. The system records the date and time associated with the complaint and activity. </p>
