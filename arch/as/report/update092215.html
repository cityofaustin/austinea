<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>A Rescue Organization contacts the Austin Animal Center and voices interest in becoming a rescue partner. They are provided an application that they fill out. They are vetted by the Rescue Coordinator. If accepted, they are added to the system and sent a welcome letter. Lastly, the Rescue Coordinator adds the Rescue Organization to various email distribution lists ensuring they receive notification when animals of their interest are available.

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Onboard Rescue Partners Interface Descriptions</p>
<!-- Table definition -->
<table align="center" id="custom">
<tr><th width="195">Type/Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Rescue Coordinator/ <br /> provideRescueApplication</td> <td>The Rescue Coordinator requests contact information (email address), and sends the Rescue Application Packet (PDF) to the Rescue Organization. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Rescue Organization/ <br /> completeRescueApplicationAndEmail</td> <td>The Rescue organization fills out the application providing name, address, organization adoption application/ contract, their foster contract, their 501(c)(3) (nonprofit designation), shelter and veterinary references, interview questions (how many animals they maintain, what are their sources for animals, brief medical protocol description, spay/neuter protocol, social enrichment protocol, decision-making process for humane euthanasia, adoption protocol, foster home protocol, do they plan to transport animals from shelter to other unproved groups, and if they house their animals in facility/kenneling environment? ). *Occasionally, a site visit is required. </td> </tr>
 
<tr>
<td>Microsoft Outlook/<br /> createFolderForRescueOrganization</td> <td>The Rescue Coordinator creates a folder within Outlook for the Rescue Group. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Rescue Coordinator/<br /> vetRescueOrganization</td> <td>The Rescue Coordinator calls their reference and talks about how the Rescue Group engages this Vet. Questions asked: Is the Rescue Organization a client (if yes, for how long), the services they provide to the group, do they follow medical advice/recommendations, do the animals in their care appear to get better, do they observe the length of stay of the animals and do they get adopted, if they have concerns about the length of stay, and general comments. Additionally, the Rescue Coordinator does a shelter check, calls one or two of the shelters with whom they do business, and asks if they transfer animals to the group, for how long (if not, then why not), how many animals a year they take, if they have any knowledge of the organization's processes for adoption, and their rescue group's screening process (applications already completed). This is often handled via email, with a note to "call" if convenient.  </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Rescue Coordinator/<br /> contactOrganizationAndRejectApplications</td> <td>The Rescue Coordinator contacts the Rescue Organization and indicates they have not passed reference check for becoming an approved Austin Animal Center Rescue Partner.  </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Rescue Coordinator/<br /> conductPhoneInterview</td> <td>The Rescue Coordinator contacts the Rescue Partner and conducts a phone interview. This interview includes some of the questions previously discussed on the original application. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Provide Animal Rescue and Shelter/<br /> addAndUpdatePersonAndAnimalInfo</td> <td>Customer Service/Foster Coordinator/Other users will access the system and add or update person and animal info. They will include information like owner, owner address, pet name, pet breed, pet sex, pet microchip info, rabies certificate information, as well as other important information. If the animal or person is already in the system, Customer Service uses the system to update the information. In the case of Trappers, add the date they signed the Standards of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure. In the event of Volunteer Applicant for Trappers, the Outreach Education Team will access the system and provide information from the Trapper Application to create a person info record for the Applicant (including verification date and time for the signing of the Standard of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure), if one does not already exist. If a person info record exists, the Outreach Education Team will update the information as necessary based on the Applicant's information. 
For Spay/Neuter, the user modifies the sex of the animal from M/F (male/female) to S/N (Spay/Neuter), and records the date of surgery, date processed, and vet clinic ID (the system maintains a list of all vet clinics on record within the area.)
Foster Coordinators create person info records for Citizens acting/assisting with foster care, and annotate animal info records with information indicating Foster Care Providers who have taken ownership of the animals. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Rescue Coordinator/<br /> sendWelcomeLetterToRescueOrganization</td> <td>The Rescue Coordinator sends an email welcoming the Rescue Partner to the shelter. The email contains all the information about what to expect as a Rescue Partner, such as contact information, hours of operation, a brief overview of how the shelter works, medical procedures, voucher program, how to interact with animals in the shelter, 311 guide, how to confirm or express interest in an animal, how to pick up an animal, their organization's PersonID, as well as warns that their information is public record within the Austin Animal Center software. Lastly, they are encouraged to reach out to the AAC if they have any questions. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Microsoft Outlook/<br /> addRescueOrganizationToOutlookDistroLists</td> <td>The Rescue Coordinator uses Outlook and adds the Rescue Organization to the applicable distribution lists (this will align with the breed and type of animal preferred by the Rescue Partner.) Also, there is a large distribution list of all Rescue Partners. </td> </tr>
