<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Volunteer Group Contact accesses the Animal services Website and fills out a request for a one time volunteer group visit. The volunteer coordinator accesses the system and determines if this group has visited before. If they have, the new proposed dates are added to their record, otherwise a new record is created for the group. The Volunteer coordinator accesses GivePulse and posts a request for a "mentor" for the date(s) specified as potential dates of the visit by the Volunteer Group Contact. Once a Mentor is found, the Volunteer Coordinator sends email verifying the date chosen and updates the Volunteer Group's information on the system to reflect the agreed upon visit date.  The Volunteer Group attends orientation and is led by the mentor through their visit. The Volunteer Coordinator will take a photograph of the group, attach it to their record in the system, as well as (later) post the picture to the City Of Austin's Animal Services Facebook Page. Lastly the Volunteer coordinator hands out Volunteer Applications to the group attendee's interested in pursuing volunteer engagements with Animal Services. The Volunteer Coordinator will send email after the group departs, thanking them for visiting.</p>
