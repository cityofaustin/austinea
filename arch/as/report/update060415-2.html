<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Citizen comes into the Animal Services or accesses the system from the internet and signs up for a Responsible Pet Owner Class. On the day of the class, the Citizen, shows proof of rabies vaccination and/or court order documents, and pays the fee for the class. For citizens with a citation, the citation compliance date is they date by which they must attend the class. Traditionally, the class size is 10 people. 
The day of the class, the Outreach Education Team prints out the roster of who will be attending and Print Certificates (pre-printed with all the names of the people on the roster.) The Outreach Education team will setup the computer, check each person’s ID, get each Citizen to sign the attendance roster and teach the presentation. 
Upon completion the Outreach Education team will hand out certificates to each attendee, and shred the certificates made for Citizens that didn’t attend. 
Lastly, the Outreach Education Team accesses the system and records the Attendance date and time for each Citizen that attended.   </p>
