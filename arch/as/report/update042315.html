<p>Hi All,</p> 
</div>

<p>Attached is the information for the "Manage Spay Neuter Outreach Services" use case that was reviewed April 23rd, 2015, with the Animal Services Team. Please take a moment to check my work and let me know if there are any changes I can make to improve this, or if this requirement is as discussed! Please remember that this specific flow is not exactly as the current process is done today, but a conceptualization of what we would like a new system to do for Animal Services in the future. </p> <p>

Additionally, I wanted to let you know the Online repository of Animal Services Use Cases is now up to date ( http://austinea.org/arch/as/report/index.html )

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>An animal is identified as needing the Spay, Neuter, Outreach services. This is either from a customer request (animal discovered and they are temporarily caretaking), a mobile unit seeing the animal on the street, a field officer referral, or from a log of previous contact with a customer.) The Outreach Team reaches out to the customer and gets information related to the animal. If the customer can provide their own transportation for the animal, they are referred to a website with detailed information about Emancipet and their services. Otherwise, the Outreach Team creates an Activity on the system for pickup and return of the animal. Once created, they Outreach Team contacts the animal Services Dispatcher to indicate the start of an activity. The Outreach Team then goes to the address received from the Customer and picks up the animal and takes it to Emancipet. Once the surgery is done, if the owner can pick up the animal, they will. Otherwise the Outreach Team will go back to Emanicipet and take the animal back to the customer. Once complete, they Outreach Team contacts Animal Services Dispatch to indicate they have completed the Activity. Once back on site, the Outreach Team accesses the system and updates the salient information about the engagement. </p>
