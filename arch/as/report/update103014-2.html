<p>Hi All,</p> 
</div>

<p>Attached is the information for the "Manage Fleet Reservation" use case that was reviewed October 30th, 2014, with the Animal Services Team. Please take a moment to check my work and let me know if there are any changes I can make to improve this, or if this requirement is as discussed! </p>

Additionally, I wanted to let you know the Online repository of Animal Services Use Cases is now up to date ( /arch/as/report/index2.html )

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Vehicle Reservationist (Fleet Officer, Admin Personnel, Customer Service or Fleet Manager) accesses the system and indicates they would like to reserve or unreserve a vehicle.  The System displays a list of all fleet vehicles currently assigned.  The Display includes Vehicle Tracking No., Vehicle Make, Model, Capacity, and whether animals can be transported with the vehicle.  Additionally the display includes the person currently assigned to the vehicle, their person Id, the date they took possession of the vehicle, and the date they are to relinquish the vehicle.
The Reservationist indicates the date on which they would like to reserve the vehicle. If authorized (role based privileges), Reservationists reserve vehicles for others (if the employee for which the reservation is made's personinfo record indicates "isAllowedToUseFleet".) Otherwise, Reservationists only reserve vehicles for themselves.
Reservationists also remove (release) reservations in the same manner. </p>
