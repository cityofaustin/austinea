<p>Hi All,</p> 
</div>

<p>Attached is the information for the updated "Manage Community Cat Services" use case that was reviewed May 7th, 2015, with the Animal Services Team. Please take a moment to check my work and let me know if there are any changes I can make to improve this, or if this requirement is as discussed! Please remember that this specific flow is not exactly as the current process is done today, but a conceptualization of what we would like a new system to do for Animal Services in the future. </p> <p>

Additionally, I wanted to let you know the Online repository of Animal Services Use Cases is now up to date ( /arch/as/report/index2.html )

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>A Cat is identified as needing the Community Cat Services. This is either from a customer request (animal discovered and they are temporarily caretaking), a mobile unit seeing it on the street, a field officer referral, or from a log with previous contact with the team, reaches out to the complainant to get information about the cat(s). The Outreach & Education Team accesses the system and adds the cat(s) the trapper list. The Field officer accesses the system and retrieves a list of all animals to be trapped that day. They contact Animal Services Dispatch to indicate the start of an activity, they Trap the animal, deliver the animal to the Mobile Mini and then return it from whence it came. Once completed the Field Officer contacts Animal Services Dispatch to indicate completion of an activity. Note: it is desirable to que the start and ending activity on an IPAD in the field as opposed to physically calling the dispatcher.  </p>
