<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Upon arrive the arriving animal is given a cursory examination by the technician and a decision is made about the animal. It is either in healthy condition, needs attention (but not an emergency), or needs immediate attention. 
Healthy Animals and non-emergency animals are examined by the Intake vaccinator, who will administer required vaccines and update the animal information in the system. 
In Emergency situations, the veterinarian is paged via the overhead paging system and the Vet performs an examination. In parallel, the Floating Technician examines the animal, searches for microchip, and updates animal information. Additionally the Floating Technician performs requested diagnostics and administers treatments as dictated by the vet. Then the Vet examines and evaluates the animal's condition for a period of time until they are well enough to be moved to general care.
The technician then schedules for an animal to be moved... sometimes to general kennels, sometimes to rabies or worm quarantine areas. The Animal information is once again updated in the system to indicate the location of the animal.  
If the veterinarian has a scheduled appointment for animal evaluation, they will examine the animal, and a floating technician will perform any diagnostics required. If treatments are needed, the Veterinary will schedule them in the system.</p>
