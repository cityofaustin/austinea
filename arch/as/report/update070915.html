<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>An Applicant either calls Animal Services or emails community cat's website, or accesses the Animal Services' website. If they have not accessed the website, they will be directed to do so and fill out an application. If an email was received, the outreach team will respond with an email and attach the application. The applicant can either email or return the application in person. The Outreach team checks to see if this applicant is already on the system (personid), and creates a person info record if they are not. The Outreach team sets up an orientation meeting. The applicant is sent "standards for conduct", and the "Standard Operating Procedures" that must be signed. The applicant is given access codes to the Animal Services Campus and the Mobile Mini. And then the Outreach team adds the applicant to GivePulse. </p>
