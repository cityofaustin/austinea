<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Boxes are received at the Animal Services facility. The Animal Services Administrator notifies the appropriate team members that drugs have been delivered to the facility. The Drug Receiver will open the box and store the medicines in their proper locations. If there is no Veterinarian available, and controlled substances have been delivered, the controlled substances are stored in a locked safe room until the Veterinarian can handle the controlled substance intake. Once the drugs have been verified, the Drug Receiver enters the receipt of the drugs into the system. For controlled substances a Veterinarian and another Drug Receiver must both be present, verify the drug storage, and then make entries into a DEA Log book (as required by law.) Once drugs have been added to the system and stored and logged, the Drug Receiver forwards the invoice to the Inventory Technician for reconciliation. 
NOTE: There is a desire to have barcodes of drugs programmed within the system, allowing for a single barcode scan to identify and the drug, automatically know quantity and dosage per item, and add the appropriate information to the system. </p>

<td>Provide Animal Rescue and Shelter/ <br /> scanPlaceAndRecordInventory</td> <td>The Drug Receiver uses the system to record the receipt of drugs. This includes recording the type, lot number, dosage, manufacturer, date added, date medicine will expire, and count of each item received.
For controlled substances, the Vet and Drug Receiver verifies the accuracy of the shipment, scans and labels the drugs, enters the info into inventory management log books (DEA requirement). The System manages a list of DEA transactions for recall during audits. On the 222 hardcopy that has been saved, the receipt of the drugs is also recorded/confirmed on the documentation. 
NOTE: There is a desire to have barcodes or similar automation technology to allow for a simple scan to propagate information to the system. </td> </tr>
