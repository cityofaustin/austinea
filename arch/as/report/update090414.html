<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>Attached is the information for the "Intake Animal" use case that was reviewed September 4th, 2014, with the Animal Services Team. Please take a moment to check my work and let me know if there are any changes I can make to improve this, or if this requirement is as discussed! </p> <p>

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Animals are received by Intake Staff or by Animal Protection.
The Customer Contact verifies jurisdiction authority limiting services to the appropriate citizens (Austin City, and (unincorporated Travis County). 
The Customer Contact determines if the animal is a stray, or owner surrender, or public assist (temporary shelter). If the animal is accepted in to care, the Customer Contact enters information about the person surrendering the animal as well as the animal itself. The Customer Contact also collects the location where animal is found. Animal Geo location information is determined and fed to a website straymapper.com - An interface with FINDING ROVER is desirable.  The system provides a means for the Animal Source to enter animal personality profile information into the system via the web or a kiosk and for Customer Contacts to access that information. 
The system provides the ability to integrate with a micro-chip scanner. The system provides a service Intake from the Austin Customer Service 311 system. </p>

<tr>
<td>Customer Contact/ <br /> scanAnimalForMicrochip</td> <td>The Customer Contact scans the animal for the presence of a microchip. The System automatically interfaces with the microchip scanner, locating matching animal info records when a match exists.  </td> </tr>
