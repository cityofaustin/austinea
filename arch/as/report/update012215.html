<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>A new Applicant accesses the Animal Services web site and applies to become a volunteer by filling out an online application. The Applicant provides personal information and is provided a Criminal NAD background check form to print, sign and return to Animal Services. The Applicant can mail or personally deliver the signed background check form to Animal Services. The Volunteer Coordinator accesses the system and checks to see if new Applicants have added applications. Once the signed background check authorization has been provided, the Volunteer Coordinator accesses the Background Check system (CBI) and enters the Applicant's information for validation. 
If the Applicant has lived outside of Texas anytime in the previous 10 years, they are required to additionally get their fingerprints checked. In this case, the Applicant is provided information about where the Finger Print Agency is, and the process by which the Applicant gets their finger print security check. The results of the fingerprint check are sent to the Department of Public Safety (DPS) and ultimately transferred to the City of Austin Criminal Background Check Database by COA Human resources. If results in the CBI database have not been updated for the Applicant after a week, the Volunteer Coordinator will send email to COA HR in an effort to expedite the request. 
If the Applicant fails the background check, the Volunteer Coordinator sends a rejection letter to the Applicant, otherwise the Applicant is sent an email inviting them to Orientation. At Orientation the Applicant chooses an initial preference (Dogs or Cats), and they are provided the standard Volunteer Packet. Additionally they are asked to complete and sign a Code of Conduct form, and if the Applicant desires off hours work, they are provided and asked to sign an Access Agreement. The Applicant is taught how to use the GivePulse Time tracking system, and assigned a mentor. The Applicant and Volunteer Coordinator decided the first working day, which is coordinated with the Assigned Mentor (or if none is available, the Volunteer Coordinator.) The Applicant attends their first day of work, and then the Volunteer Coordinator has discuss with the mentor and applicant about their first shift at the Animal Shelter.</p>
