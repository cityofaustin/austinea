<p>Hi All,</p> 
</div>

<p>Attached is the information for the updated "Distribute Drugs" use case that was reviewed July 23rd, 2015, with the Animal Services Team. Please take a moment to check my work and let me know if there are any changes I can make to improve this, or if this requirement is as discussed!  </p> <p>

Additionally, I wanted to let you know the Online repository of Animal Services Use Cases is now up to date ( http://austinea.org/arch/as/report/index.html )

<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>Three times a day the Veterinary Technician uses the system to print a daily treatment list that indicates drugs, quantity and receiving animal. For controlled substances, the Veterinarian goes into the safe room, gets what's needed, and makes entries in the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) log book that is maintained. The Veterinarian can, at any time, use the system to record additional treatments or drug needs for any animal, which then are added to the treatment list. Treatments are not limited to administering of drugs, and may include non-drug therapies. NOTE: There is the desire to introduce automation, allowing Animal Services Staff to use Barcode scanners (or RFI chip, etc.) to scan kennels and a list of barcodes on the treatment sheet, to annotate treatments provided, decrement inventory, etc.   </p>

<!-- Table definition -->
<table align="center" id="custom">
<tr><th width="195">Type/Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Animal Rescue and Shelter/ <br /> retrieveAnimalDrugPrescriptions</td> <td>The Veterinary Technician uses the system to create a report of all animals scheduled for treatment, and their associated treatments. The Veterinary Technician specifies a date range and the system generates a printout including AnimalId, Animal Kennel Location, treatment to be given, time and date treatment is due, quantity of treatment to administer, and Prescribing Veterinarian. </td> </tr>

<tr> 
<td>Veterinary Technician/ <br /> dispenseDrugsToAnimal</td> <td>The Veterinary Technician refers to the DailyTreatmentReport and dispenses drugs to the various animals scheduled for treatment during that time period. The treatment could be either a protocol that is being followed by the Veterinary Technician, or specific treatment prescribed by the Veterinarian. </td> </tr>
 
<tr>
<td>Provide Animal Rescue and Shelter/ <br /> recordDrugDistribution</td> <td>Either a Veterinarian or a Veterinary Technician uses the system to record the administration of drugs/drug protocols for a specific animal. The information includes AnimalID, medications/treatments provided, date/time of treatment, and quantities of drugs used. The system uses this information to modify Inventory counts of on-hand drugs. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Provide Animal Rescue and Shelter/ <br /> enterDrugPrescriptionForAnimal</td> <td>The Veterinarian uses the system to record specific treatments or protocols to be administered to a specific animal. The Veterinarian provides AnimalID, frequency, dosage of a specific drug (or treatment), and the length of time the treatment is supposed to be administered (with an option to indicate the treatment is ongoing "until Animal shows improvement"). </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Veterinary Technician/<br /> retrieveDrugsFromProtocolSupplySafeRoom</td> <td>The Veterinary Technician retrieves Controlled substances drugs that are part of a protocol from a "safe room" (differing from the scheduled 2 locked room). They are unaccompanied during this drug retrieval. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Veterinary Technician/<br /> retrieveAnimalForPets</td> <td>The Veterinary Technician retrieves Animals ten minutes after controlled substances are administered. Animal is thoroughly petted and cuddled for maximum healing powers. Animal is returned to cage after 60 minutes of petting. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Veterinary Technician/<br /> enterDrugUsageInDEALogBook</td> <td>The Veterinarian Technician makes entries in a log book indicating which drugs, what dosage, date, time, reason for need, and providing a signature, in compliance with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) rules. </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>Vet/<br /> retrieveDrugFromSafeRoom</td> <td>The Veterinarian goes to the safe room, accompanied by a Veterinary Technician, and retrieves non-protocol schedule 2 drugs for treatment of an Animal. NOTE: It is desirable for the staff to have the ability to scan barcodes causing the system to automatically decrement the inventory managed by the system. </td> </tr>


<tr>
<td>Vet/<br /> enterDrugUsageInDEALogBook</td> <td>The Veterinarian makes entries in a log book indicating which drugs, what dosage, date, time, reason for need, and providing a veterinary signature, in compliance with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) rules. </td> </tr>
