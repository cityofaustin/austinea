<p><b>Use Case Scope</b></p>
<p>The Citizen contacts animal services (via 311/customer service/direct call/email) to advertise their event and request Austin Animal Services personnel attend. An Animal Services person is assigned the request, and it is forwarded to the Animal Service Marketing team. The marketing team checks the calendar and determines if Austin Animal Services will be participating in the event. If so, the Animal services contact seeks volunteers for the event through the GivePulse application (if Volunteers are needed). Once volunteers are found (or if no volunteers are needed), the Animal Services contact reaches out to the Animal Services Marketing team to provide marketing materials, and then the Animal services contact scheduled the event on the calendar. The citizen is contacted and confirmation is given. If the marketing team determines the event is not something in which the city would like to invest time and money, or if no volunteers can be located and are needed, the Animal Services Contact reaches out to the Citizen to let them know Animal Services will not be attending the event.  </p>
