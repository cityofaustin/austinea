<p><b>Scope: </b>The Behavior Team runs a report showing animal that needs assessment by the Behavior Team. Additionally, they run the Behavior Lock Report. Each animal on the list is evaluated to determine their adoptability and their social interaction skills. Given this assessment, the Behavior Team will take various courses of action from suggesting an animal stay or be removed from behavior modification training and service, to suggesting foster or rescue placement, to suggesting movement to Pets Alive, or even euthanasia. If an animal is deemed potentially harmful, it is designated as being on Behavioral Lock, and a physical lock is placed on the animal's cage. Once the evaluations are done, the Behavior Team uses the system to record the animal disposition and behavioral information within the AnimalInfo record. Additionally, the Behavior Team will placed corresponding colored dots on the animal's kennel, providing a visual cue to other Animal Services personnel pertaining to the animal's behavioral status.

They will include information like owner, owner address, pet name, pet breed, pet sex, pet microchip info, rabies certificate information, as well as other important information. If the animal or person is already in the system, Customer Service uses the system to update the information. In the case of Trappers, add the date they signed the Standards of Conduct and the Standard Operating Procedure. In the event of Volunteer Applicant for Trappers, the Outreach Education Team will access the system and provide information from the TrapperApplication to create a PersonInfo record for the Applicant (including verification date and time for the signing of the Standard of Conduct, and the Standard Operating Procedure), if one does not already exist. If a PersonInfo record exists, the Outreach Education Team will update the information as necessary based on the Applicant’s information. 
For spay/neuter, the user modifies the sex of the animal from M/F (male/female) to S/N (spay/neuter), and records the date of surgery, date processed, vet clinic ID (the system maintains a list of all vet clinics on record within the area).
