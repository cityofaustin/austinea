<td>What other municipalities utilize EA and have an EA policy? How have they implemented their policy and staffed the program?</td>

<td>I beleive we're leaders in the municipality EA space. I have yet to discover any municipality employing EA as a means to align IT services to business. I reached out regionally and met EAs from Dallas, Houston, Travis County, LCRA, among others and they are at best teetering on the edges of EA. I joined the local chapter of the Association for Enterprise Architects (AEA) scouting for performance records. In reality, these folks too are performing solution/system architecture and calling it EA. EA's purpose, by definition, is to align information technology services to the business needs of the enterprise. I'm following the guidance outlined by the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), which I have much experience. In Addition, I was coauthor of the Department of Defense Enterprise Architecture Framework (DoDAF) version 1.5 and well versed on required EA policies.</td>

<td>Is EA a program as defined by the Budget Office that will have activities? Is the EA Program Office under the CIO or its own separate office list the Innovation Office? Will it exist under CTM's budget and be part of their allocation?</td>

<td>Yes, we'd prefer the EAPMO be officially designated and acknowledged by the Budget Office. For now, it's proposed the EAPMO fall under the role of the Chief Information Office, whose activity is under CTM's budget. We need to recognize, however, that the EAPMO is not a function of CTM, which is more of an operational arm of IT. Rather, EAPMO is a corporate role and a function of the CIO. Frequently, folks refer to the CTM Chief EA, when they should be refering to the COA Chief EA. The policy is meant to clarify this distinction.</td>

<td>It is a little confusing in the document as far as answering the question of â€œWho does the Chief EA directly reports to the City Manager or CIO?â€?.  In the base document the is a wire diagram on page 10 that shows a relational approach to multiple entities.  I believe in Attachment C, it refers to the Chief EA reports to the CIO.  So is Attachment C correct?</td>

<td>The Chief EA reports to the CIO. I'll update the roadmap to clarify. Someday, however, the Chief EA should report to the CMO similar to the Innovation Office. When we realize EA's full potential, this will become more evident.</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>I am not sure what authority you are seeking that the policy is going to give the Chief EA and program team? Could you elaborate a little?  I am not sure I understand the difference to what you are doing now to what you are asking for.</td>

<td>The policy is mostly about clarity of purpose. Although Public Works recognizes the value of EA and we're exercising a stable partnership, this is not the situation citywide. EA, for some, is viewed as an optional activity. When in reality, EA is the voice of business and an important stepping stone to guide IT to viable and efficient business solutions. The policy empowers our EA as the official IT blueprint (i.e., authoritative source of business requirements). Essentially, the policy is formalizing the role of EA to eliminate confusion both inside and outside of CTM on where EA's responsibility and authority resides.</td>

<td>I am a little confused about City or Department Strategy Development and EA. Do you see EA the conduit that links a Strategy to system and data architecture?</td>

<td>I do... This may take a while, however, we should revamp our entire business planning process to include EA. Information technology is a "significant" business capital (~$75M per year) and possibly the largest contributing element to our best-managed vision (outside of skilled human leadership). Enterprise Architecture = Business/Operational Architecture + Solution/System Architecture + Technical/Standards Architecture. Data architecture logically is part of the business architecture domain and physically part of the solution architecture domain. All, of which, falls under EA guidance and authority.</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>How does the Data Architect and Chief EA fit together?</td>

<td>Data architecture is part of the enterprise and therefore, part of the enterprise architecture.</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>In your vision, is EA limited to the â€œrational softwareâ€? that you currently utilize or can other means be utilized?  For example, Asset Management Strategies can be assisted through the use of many computerize maintenance management systems like Hansen or Maximo.</td>

<td>As for "architecture" tooling and training, EA is responsible to ensure configuration of this information and its processes. I don't see a relationship between architecture tooling and business application services such as Hansen or Maximo. You can learn more regarding these relationships from the <a href="/austinea/whitepaper/yearEndReport/">EA Year End Report</a>.</td>
