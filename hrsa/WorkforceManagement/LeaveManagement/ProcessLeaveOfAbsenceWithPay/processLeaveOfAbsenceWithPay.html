<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>

<p>The Department Administrator notifies the Benefits Specialist via letter that an employee is on leave of absence using sick, vacation or compensation time for an extended period of time. The Benefits Specialist biweekly monitors benefits deductions and available leave time until the employee returns to work. If the employee runs short of leave time, the Benefits Specialist performs Process Leave of Absence Without Pay.
