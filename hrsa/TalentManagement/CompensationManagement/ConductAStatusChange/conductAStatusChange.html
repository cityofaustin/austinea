<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>

<p>A status change occurs when an employee moves from Regular position to a Temporary position. These changes effect the employees leave and medical benefits. This may include changing the type of employee (temporary, regular), benefit changes, staffing level changes, and employee class changes, leave category, salary grade, salary group, leave accrual, title, pay grade, location code, funding, department, seniority date, job effective date, personnel date, job begin date, work week, FTE, etc. The "in lieu of" employee class has no validation in Banner. The electronic personnel action form (ePAF) process can incorrectly populate both the Job and/or the employee form. A monthly review is conducted to assess errors.
