<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>

<p>Monthly, the Third Party Administrator (TPA) sends the Monthly Enrollment Summary Report containing a summary of the benefit elections for retired employees. The Employee Benefits Division Specialist compares the report against a Retiree Summary in the Retiree Access Database. Discrepancies are identified and corrected prior to paying appropriate vendors.
