<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>
<p>When enrolling a newly hired employee, the employee is instructed to bring certain new hire information to the New Employee Orientation and presented with a benefits presentation and provided supporting benefits materials. If the employee does not have the necessary supporting documentation, they complete the Benefits Enrollment Form without dependents and follow up with the Employee Benefits Division to add dependents after presenting proper documentation. The Benefits Specialist performs Enroll Benefits Elections to enter the employee's benefit elections into the Banner system.
