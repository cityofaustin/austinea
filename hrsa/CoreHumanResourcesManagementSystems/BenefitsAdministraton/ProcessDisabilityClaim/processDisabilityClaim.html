<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>

<p>The Employee Benefits Division Specialist intakes the Short Term Disability Application and reviews for completeness. The Employee sends the application to the Carrier who reviews for approval. If denied, the Benefits Specialist advises Employee on right to appeal. If approved, the Benefits Specialist notifies the Employee and the Department Administrator of the approved dates. If the Employee has Long Term Disability and it is determined that the disability requires more than 90 days, the Carrier opens a long term disability claim and the Benefits Specialist updates a database with long term disability rollover information. The Employee and Department Administrator are notified of the approval dates. If the Employee has a total disability the Benefits Specialist opens a life waiver claim and informs the Carrier to process life waiver claim with additional employer paperwork. The Benefits Specialist concludes by creating a life waiver file on the Employee.
