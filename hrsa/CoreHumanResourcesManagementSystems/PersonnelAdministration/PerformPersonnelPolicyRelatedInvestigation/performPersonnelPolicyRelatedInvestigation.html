<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>
<p>When a Personnel policy complaint is indicated, an appropriate representative (designated) of either Department or Corporate Human Resources determines suitability of the issue and assigns an Investigating Department. The designated investigator performs a thorough intake to identify appropriate scope for investigation, develops an investigation plan, and executes the investigation by interviewing the Complainant, Respondent, and Witnesses, and reviews related documentation. After investigation conclusion, a report is written that identifies the allegation and any associated policy violations. Process concludes with a close out meeting with Department Director and appropriate corrective action determination, if any.
