<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>

<p>An APD employee is interested in taking on additional work with another employer. Employers are investigated by the APD Intelligence unit and the Chain of Command makes a decision as to whether to allow the officer the second position. The APD HR Liaison maintains a database of all employers that have been checked. A successful authorization of an employer lasts for two years, after which time they must be recertified.
