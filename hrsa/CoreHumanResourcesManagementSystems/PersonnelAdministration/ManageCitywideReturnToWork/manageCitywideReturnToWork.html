<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>

<p>When an employee has been injured on the job or Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) approved, the City offers the benefit of the Return to Work program. This program is designed to afford the employee time to recover from their injury and possibly place them in an alternate position.
