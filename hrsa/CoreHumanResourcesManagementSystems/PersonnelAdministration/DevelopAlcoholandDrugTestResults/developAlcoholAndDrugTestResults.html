<h2>Use Case Scope</H2>

<p>Establish Drug and Alcohol testing and potentially notifying the Department HR Liaison of specific test results. A Third Party Generates a list of people (random names) monthly of which employees need to be tested, to be in Federal compliance. Additionally, some departments can request Drug Tests for pre-employment hiring, post Leave test, purposes. If a current CDL Employee is found to be using drugs or alcohol based on test results, they are referred to a substance abuse treatment program.
