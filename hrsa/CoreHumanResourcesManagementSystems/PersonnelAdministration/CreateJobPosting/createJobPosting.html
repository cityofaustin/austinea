<h2>Use Case Scope</h2>

<p>When the Hiring Manager identifies an open position, the Hiring Manager sends a hiring need to the Hiring Facilitator. The Hiring Facilitator coordinates with the Hiring Manager to develop a hiring strategy and relevant posting information. The hiring strategy may include the need to create a non-city job posting such as in professional journals, non-city job advertising Web sites, and/or various magazines. The non-city posting can vary from a simple paragraph possibly including a link to the city posting or an elaborate job description eliciting new potentials to join the city team. The final city posting is quality checked by the Quality Assurance Representative and published to the city job posting Web site.
