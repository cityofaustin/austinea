<p style="font-weight: bold;">IT Strategic Planning</p>

<p>IT strategic planning is an instrumental role of a good enterprise architecture (EA) practice. In particular, EA strategically aligns information technology (IT) goods and services to meet the business needs of the enterprise. Historically, however, organizations such as CTM have not used EA methods to perform strategic planning. Many strategic planning roles belong to ad hoc relegated individuals - in many cases, these individuals do not recognize EA with these strategic responsibilities. This situation creates a daunting challenge for EA and requires leadership support to leverage legacy responsibilities into a successful EA practice. For example, a common response, &quot;Who says this responsibility belongs to EA?&quot; There's no one better qualified then the city's Chief Enterprise Architect to make these kinds of determinations.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: Develop customer focused service model for each CTM department (ex., applications, infrastructure, project management, etc.). Apply EA methods and processes during this activity - abandon any previous concepts or notions previously considered. If significant, previous strategic items resurface at their appropriate place in the architecture. There's only one source of knowledge for IT strategic planning and it's the architecture currently being modeled using Rational Software Architect with the Extension for Integrated Architecture.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: ITIL is an industry best practice approach to manage IT resources. A configuration management database (CMDB) is instrumental to a successful ITIL program. In order to succeed in our ITIL endeavor, establish an architecture to represent CMDB requirements supporting CTM ITIL processes.</p>

<hr />

<p style="font-weight: bold;">PDR Electronic Planning Review</p>

<p>EA met over a period of several months and created a comprehensive business architecture representing the business needs to Ensure Regulatory Compliance of various building plans requiring city permits. Current processes require a manual method of handling paper plans to provide review and comment feedback prior to permit issuance. Electronic Planning and Review (EPR) project proposes to automate the submission process by providing city clients (Submittal Applicants) opportunity to submit plans electronically and provide enhanced electronic feedback features leading to a more efficient and streamlined process. The RFP included EA functional and technical specifications to select an optimal vendor product, which requires integration with the city's current Case Management tool, Amanda. The EA proved highly useful in vendor selection - Avolve's ProjectDox provided optimal integrated solution.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: Use business architecture to drive solution architecture providing integration functional touch-points useful for work breakdown functional responsibilities between CSDC (Amanda) and Avolve (ProjectDox). Employ interface integration using our IBM Integration Bus. Identify Amanda producing and consuming interface requirements to establish contractual agreement with CSDC to ensure timely product integration. Both CSDC and Avolve participated in architecture collaborative sessions to ensure effective workflow capture. Additional solution architecture work needed to identify functional flow for Amanda Web portal.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Safety Database</p>

<p>Promote employee safety by providing a management system to perform safety training, conducting investigations, ensure corrective actions, ensuring state compliance (drivers license/workers compensation) and documentation, ensure regulatory physicals, respond to drug/alcohol testing, Manage Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) considerations, respond to Department of Transportation (DOT) point counts, perform truck/facility inspections and audits (training needs, ergonomics, etc.), managed standard operating procedures (SOPs), hazard assessments, and manage Workers Compensation claims.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: The <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/arr/">Employee Safety Database</a> architecture is mature and ready for applicable use. On Tuesday, September 02, 2014, we established an agreement with Austin Resource Recovery and salesforce.com to pilot EA use cases to include <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/arr/establishIncidentReport/">Establish Incident Report</a> and <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/arr/performIncidentInvestigation/">Perform Incident Investigation</a>. The pilot is not to provide a fully functional safety system, rather to demonstrate Cloud technology useful to employee safety. A secondary purpose of the pilot was to demonstrate EA artifacts ability to deliver viable and acceptable business application solutions. Salesforce successfully provided demonstration at the CIO Council meeting on November 7, 2014 - Salesforce met both objectives with astonishing results.</p>

<hr />

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Establish Event Booking</p>

<p>Purchase of an Event Booking System (EBS) including software licensing and implementation services for and in accordance with the specifications and provisions contained herein. The objective is to secure a world class solution to manage all aspects of booking and facilitating services for events and event space. The ACCD prefers that the solution offered by the proposing party support and integrate with record retention guidelines, security management systems and portals, content management systems, and public facing web sites. The solution should also operate as a standalone tool, independent of one or all system integrations.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: Submitted request for proposal (RFP) and selected vendor. Enterprise architecture successfully delivered the <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/acc/">Establish Event Booking</a> system <a href="http://austinea.org/definition/#functional_specification">functional and technical specifications</a> on 11 Aug 2014.</p>

<hr />

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Animal Services</p>

<p>Find replacement for Camilion, the current Animal Services application for animal shelter management. It's interesting to note that Camilion's orginal purpose was to manage jails - i.e., human incarceration units, which was adapted for animal incarceration until more permanent arrangements can be determined.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: Archtecture under development - acquisition strategy in work.</p>

<hr />

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Environmental Health Services</p>

<p><b>Purpose: </b>Although an acqusition is not yet approved, Enviromental Health Services requested EA to perform an architecture analysis of their enterprise to enhance Amanda features to include Web portal, requlatory review, among other process improvements. The architecture is mature and planned to be reviewed by the Controller's office in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Status: </b>The <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/ehs/">Evironmental Health Services</a> architecture is mature and ready for staffing review. Follow link to <a href="http://austinea.org/presentation/EHSProcessImprovement.pptx">EHS Process Improvement</a> presentation.</p>

<hr />

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Electronic Health Records</p>
   
<p>Create an <a href="http://austinea.org/arch/hhs/">Electronic Health Records architecture</a> to develop request for proposal (RFP) system functional specifications similar to the Establish Event Booking system.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: Architecture development in work - require architecture to establish financial requirements.</p>

<hr />

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Code Complaince</p>

<p>Perform business process analysis to optimize Code Complaince operational procedures to enhance Case Management features and functions.</p>

<p>Roadmap Item: Establish baseline </p>
