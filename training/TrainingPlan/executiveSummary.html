<p>Stephen/Alan/Brownlee,

<p>Per our last meeting, I've completed the first draft of the <a class="nd" href="http://journeycolorado.com/whitepapers/trainingplan/trainingplan.html" target="training">City of Austin Enterprise Architecture Training Plan</a>. I made this document accessible via your iPad, iPhone or other mobile device, so you can review it anywhere at your leisure. Below is the executive outline in case you don't have time to read the entire plan, or you can browse selected items of interest because the outline is hyper-linked to sections in the plan. At the end of the executive outline, I propose <a class="nd" href="http://journeycolorado.com/whitepapers/trainingplan/trainingplan.html#performance" target="training">performance metric values</a> to measure our progress throughout the year. I look forward to your feedback.

<p>Respectfully,
-->

			<td class="alt2" style="width:20%;">Course Preparation</td>
			<td style="width:80%; background:white;">
			<a href="index.html#why" target="training">Enterprise Architecture Purpose and Value</a><br>
			Provides an overview of the value and purpose of Enterprise Architecture and the need for training.
			
			<p><a href="index.html#student" target="training">Student Preparation and Resource Needs</a><br>
			Resourcing for EA training is a great challenge. We'll need to procure EA tools as well as identify and configure a training facility suitable for the task.

			<p><a href="index.html#candidate" target="training">Identification of Candidate Architects</a><br>
			Due to limited class size (i.e., 5-10 students per series) and limited available mentors (just two), we'll need to prescreen Candidate Architects and select only the top department candidates likely to succeed. A formulized selection process is required by Human Resources to ensure objective selection.

			<td class="alt2">Enterprise Architecture Curriculum</td>
			<td style="background:white;">
			<a href="index.html#executive" target="training">Executive Enterprise Architecture Curriculum</a><br>
			Advocacy is essential to gain leadership support for EA. The executive curriculum is intended to instruct at a high-level to help city leadership understand EA's value and purpose.

			<p><a href="index.html#architect" target="training">Enterprise Architect Curriculum</a><br>
			Course curriculum to escalate the Candidate Architect to Apprentice Architect.
			
			<p><a href="index.html#advanced" target="training">Advanced EA Curriculum</a><br>
			Once the Apprentice Architect gains hands on experience, they advance to higher-level education to learn strategic architectural methods. This training is offered to Apprentice Architects after they demonstrate successful UML use case development.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="alt2">Additional Training Considerations</td>
			<td style="background:white;">
			<a href="index.html#mentorship" target="training">Mentoring Apprentice Architects</a><br>
			Training alone does not develop a skilled architect - there's an art to architecture achieved through guidance  and experience. Mentorship is a personal developmental relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. Mentorship reduces time to competency and proficiency.

			<p><a href="index.html#enterprise" target="training">Enterprise Architect Performance</a><br>
			Evaluation occurs through observation - the Candidate Architect's ability to perform tasks assigned by the instructor provides objective evaluation. HR requires objective evaluations to prevent potential subjective protest.
			
			<p><a href="index.html#reclass" target="training">Enterprise Architect Reclassification</a><br>
			Once an Apprentice Architect achieves the knowledge, skills and abilities of an IT Enterprise Architect, they are eligible for reclassification. The Chief Enterprise Architect makes recommendation to department leadership. Planned budgets are required for future Apprentice Architect reclassification.

			<p><a href="index.html#schedule" target="training">Scheduled Training</a><br>
			Once Candidate Architects are identified, tooling is procured, and appropriate facility configured, training is scheduled and executed based on the <a href="index.html#architect" target="training">outlined curriculum</a>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="alt2">Training Performance</td>
			<td style="background:white;">
			<a href="index.html#performance" target="training">EA Training Program Performance Metrics</a><br>
			Metrics to evaluate EA's training performance. Please understand, however, there are many factors outside of EA's control that could lead to less performance than anticipated.
