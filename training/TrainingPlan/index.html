<h2 id="why">Enterprise Architecture Purpose
and Value</h2>
<p>No one would think twice about creating blueprints
to construct even the simplest building or structure. Blueprints
communicate the design to builders by identifying plumbing, electrical,
structure and materials. We create blueprints to deal with complexity
and integrate the final assembly to ensure pipes, wires, etc. don't
cross doorways or windows and engineered elements provide proper
support. Code compliance professionals use blueprints to ensure proper
standards, occupant safety and even aesthetics of the design. We
frequently use blueprints as a historical record to manage structural
change such as expansions or modifications necessary to refine or
redefine the structure's purpose. Not unlike buildings, today's
information technology (IT) enterprises are very complex yet we
traditionally create and sustain them without standardized blueprints.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The&nbsp;building&nbsp;blueprinting&nbsp;process
has evolved over the last 200 years and matured to design standards
readable by the trained builder - effectively communicating design
requirements in an integrated way. Information technology, on the other
hand, has only been around sense the mid-80s with the advent of the
Internet Protocol and the evolution of IT design standards have begun
to emerge. Early computer languages such as FORTRAN and Pascal used a
structured analysis approach for code design and early blueprinting
methods such as Integrated Definition (IDEF) immerged. In the mid-90s,
object-oriented computer languages gained popularity such as ADA, C,
and Java. Practitioners of these languages synthesized the notations of
the Booch Method, the Object-Modeling Technique (OMT) and
Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) by fusing them into a
single, common and widely used modeling language called the Unified
Modeling Language (UML). In the mid-2000s, the Department of Defense
commissioned the Object Management Group to issue a Request for
Proposal to expand the UML to include infrastructure, systems and
enterprise organizational elements. This led to the Unified Profile for
Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and the UK
Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework (MODAF) referred to as the
Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM). To date, UML/UPDM is solely
the global open standard to blueprint IT architecture and is widely
adopted by many commercially available UML tools. IBM recognized the
commercial value of the UPDM, created an Extension for Integrated
Architecture for their Rational Software Architect UML tool, and called
it UML Profile-Based Integrated Architecture (UPIA). UPIA provides a
robust, highly configurable and loosely coupled standard language to
blueprint complex IT enterprises. One of the shortfalls of IDEF is that
it only employs a method (i.e., lacks a language) and doesn't employ
the concept of an interface. UML is highly interface focused and has
both a method and a language making its utility more useful to
blueprint enterprise needs.
</p>
<p>Using the standardized UML, there now exists an IT
method and language to blueprint our enterprise by improving
communications between the business stakeholder community and IT
solution providers. Enterprise Architecture is essentially our
enterprise IT <a href="/austinea/whitepaper/RequirementsManagement/index.html" target="definitions">requirements collection tool</a>.
The EA approach delivers a method to increase and improve system
integration while providing a change management framework to evolve our
enterprise over time. To be successful, however, we must tool and train
our staff to apply the UML method and language. With this added
enterprise-wide skill, we'll create a blueprint to a best-managed city.
</p>
<h2 id="student">Student Preparation and
Resource Needs</h2>
<p>Learning to employ enterprise architecture (EA) is
a complex and challenging endeavor. This challenge requires commitment
by the student and support of their leadership to exercise the
curriculum to become proficient. When the student learns a particular
method or technique, the student must apply what they've learned or the
knowledge is lost. In other words, architecture education is perishable
and quickly too! Therefore, prior to training the student must have a
fully functioning computer running either a fixed or a floating license
of IBM&#8482; <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#rsa" target="definitions">Rational Software Architect</a>
with the <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#upia" target="definitions">Extension for Integrated Architecture
(UPIA)</a>. For details on the software requirements, see <a href="#addendum">Addendum</a>.
</p>
<p>For Candidate Architects, recommend procuring a <a href="#addendum">fixed license</a>. In addition to
licensing, architects require a laptop computer running at least
Windows 7 or better. Microsoft's Remote Desktop can be an alternative;
however, this requires reliable network connectivity in all
collaborative spaces. Architecture is a collaborative venue requiring
mobility - i.e., the ability to transport the tool to various city
conference rooms equipped with projectors or SmartBoards. Recommend use
of the floating license for non-architects who only view the
architecture - a floating license may be a good option in the beginning
while we evaluate the student's performance. In addition to equipping
the Candidate Architect, we require a well-equipped training
environment.
</p>
<p>Classroom training requires a facility equipped
with the necessary EA software and network connectivity for the
students to complete instructor led exercises. The following table
outlines the Training Room requirements.</p>

<h3 id="candidate">Identification of Candidate
Architects</h3>
<p>In order to provide each student quality hands-on
opportunity along with regular instructor attention, we limit training
to eight or less students per curriculum series. Identification of
viable candidate architects is crucial because the future architect
must perform the following duties, functions and responsibilities: </p>
<ul>
<li>Develops and maintains architectural language
models </li>
<li>Analyzes and proposes business process
reengineering improvements </li>
<li>Creates logical data models defining
information element dependencies and associations </li>
<li>Assists in the facilitation of common language </li>
<li>Collaborates and vets architecture information
with customers </li>
<li>Writes specifications </li>
<li>Develops reports, presentations, schedules, and
other related materials </li>
<li>Maintains configuration management </li>
<li>Manages relationships with vendors as required
for research and validation </li>
</ul>
<p>The IT Enterprise Architect must also have the
following knowledge, skills and abilities: </p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of architecture language and models </li>
<li>Knowledge in software engineering and systems
development </li>
<li>Skill in business system analysis and
model-driven architecture </li>
<li>Skill in facilitation and technical writing </li>
<li>Ability to comprehend complex architectural
problems </li>
<li>Ability to lead team collaboration and
working-group efforts </li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a good investment in time and materials,
an initial prescreening process evaluates candidate acceptance into the
EA training program. The screening identifies the candidate's
propensity for object-oriented modeling technology and their commitment
to the program. The objective evaluation includes a measure of the
candidates experience with the knowledge, skills and abilities listed
above. The program recognizes not all candidate architects fully meet
all the knowledge, skills and abilities; however, the program selects
top candidates from these skill elements.
</p>
<p>To select viable Candidate Architects, the Chief
Enterprise Architect informs Department Leadership on the forthcoming
Enterprise Architecture training program and requests nomination of
Candidate Architects. Based on the required knowledge, skills and
abilities, the Candidate Architects submits a one-page paper explaining
why they feel qualified for EA training and what they plan to do with
their new architecture skill. Department Leadership must commit to
procuring the necessary tooling for each Candidate Architect and
provide the candidate time for study and mentoring. Mentoring occurs
based on department architecture needs - see <a href="#mentorship">Mentoring
Apprentice Architects</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="curriculum">Enterprise Architecture
Curriculum</h2>
<p>Enterprise Architecture employs three curriculums.
The first provides executive leadership understanding of enterprise
architecture and a more detailed curriculum trains future enterprise
architects to include advanced strategic development. The curriculum is
in order of required knowledge - i.e., information from previous blocks
are required to understand future curriculum sessions. Therefore, it's
critical for students to commit to the entire curriculum.
Once selected, the Candidate Architect must commit to attend the entire
curriculum - failure to attend any portion of the curriculum may result
in program elimination. Based on instructor recommendation and
extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control, the Chief
Enterprise Architect determines absentee action.

<h2 id="enterprise">Candidate Architect
Performance</h2>
<p>According to Peter A. Luongo in his book <i><a href="http://petespeaks.com/10-truths-about-leadership/">10
Truths about Leadership</a></i>, we can make someone more
than they are, but we cannot make someone something they're not. This
is the situation when developing enterprise architects - some people
don't have the conceptual ability or experience to understand the <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#interface" target="definitions">interface</a> perspective
essential to employ object-oriented concepts. Traditionally, most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst">business
analysts</a> learn to exercise structured-analysis methods, which
places emphasis on process. The Integrated Definition (IDEF) is the
most common structured-analysis method and works from a functional
decomposition principle. The object-oriented approach using the Unified
Modeling Language (UML) requires a concept shift placing emphasis on
the <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#information_element" target="definitions">information element</a> rather
than the process.
</p>
<p>During training, it becomes clear to the
instructor who is catching on to object-oriented concepts and who is
not. The Candidate Architect's ability to perform instructor assigned
architecture tasks provides objective evaluation. The candidate is
either capable of performing the assigned tasks or not. In the
beginning, the instructor does not expect the Candidate Architect to
understand object-oriented concepts; however, within the first few
weeks of training the instructor begins to recognize candidate
understanding. The instructor provides additional assistance when
needed; however, overcoming this paradigm can be difficult for some
candidates. In fact, some candidates may not be able to shift to the
object-oriented perspective. The prescreening process attempts to
identify Candidate Architect limitations; however, there's an art to
architecture and the candidate's ability to think in terms of
abstraction cannot always be determined until they attempt to apply the
object-oriented method. Upon successful completion of EA training, the
Candidate Architect becomes an Apprentice Architect and is eligible for
mentorship by an experienced Enterprise Architect.
</p>
<h3 id="mentorship">Mentoring Apprentice
Architects</h3>
<p>Mentorship is a personal developmental
relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person
helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.
However, true mentoring is more than just answering occasional
questions or providing ad hoc help. It is about an ongoing relationship
of learning, dialog, and challenge. Enterprise Architecture is actually
not much different from architectural works, in the material form of
buildings, which are often cultural symbols and works of art. To become
a building architect takes many years to include a substantial
mentorship from a certified architect in both the process and product
of planning, designing and construction. The art form of architecture
surfaces through experience and the mentor shares experience to enhance
the apprentice's knowledge by guiding them through time-consuming
pitfalls and other technical challenges.
</p>
<p>Once the student successfully completes the EA
curriculum, he or she mentors with a more experienced architect to
refine their method skills, tool usage and facilitation abilities for
tangible city EA projects. The more experienced architect acts as the
group facilitator and the Candidate Architect drives the RSA tool under
senior architect guidance. Over time (typically six to twelve months),
the apprentice gains valuable competency and confidence to progress to
facilitator. At this stage, the Candidate Architect begins to apply the
facilitator role and the more senior architect drives the architecture
tool and provides the apprentice feedback after each session.
Eventually, the apprentice obtains the knowledge, skills and abilities;
and therefore, eligible for the official position of IT Enterprise
Architect. The Chief Enterprise Architect provides Department
Leadership with regular updates on the Apprentice Architect's
performance recognizing the timing of the position change is dependent
department budgets. Through observation, the senior architect makes a
recommendation to the Chief Enterprise Architect when the apprentice is
proficient enough to have full read/write access to the City's EA <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#subversion">Subversion</a>
repository.
</p>
<h2 id="reclass">Enterprise Architect
Reclassification</h2>
<p>Apprenticeship periods vary depending on candidate
experience and the number of workable projects to practice the trade.
Typically, apprentices mentor for six to twelve months - sometimes
longer. Once an Apprentice Architect achieves the knowledge, skills and
abilities of an IT Enterprise Architect, they are eligible for position
reclassification. Per recommendation by the Chief Enterprise Architect,
Department leadership reclassify the apprentice using Human Resources
Department approved reclassification process. </p>
<p>Note: There's a plan to work with Human Resources
Department to create two new positions to include IT Enterprise
Architect and IT Enterprise Architect Senior. The salary range for
these new positions is likely higher than the current position.
Therefore, departments should budget in anticipation of their
Apprentice Architects achieving the knowledge, skills and abilities of
IT Enterprise Architect. We should recognize that EA talent is a highly
sought industry commodity, we can't afford to lose our talent after a
great deal of time, and effort went into their development. If we
manage this correctly, EA provides a new career opportunity as we move
into Cloud or other outsourced IT environments.

<h2 id="performance">EA Training Program
Performance Metrics</h2>
<p>The following metrics evaluate EA's training
performance; however, there are factors outside of EA's control that
could lead to less performance than anticipated. For example, EA can't
control department acquisition priorities, training facility
configuration and Candidate Architect or executive leadership
participation. </p>
