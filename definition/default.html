			<td>A communication technique that requires the listener to feed back what they hear to the speaker, by way of re-stating or paraphrasing what they have heard in their own words, to confirm what they have heard and moreover, to confirm the understanding of both parties. The ability to listen actively demonstrates sincerity, and that nothing is being assumed or taken for granted. Active listening is most often used to improve personal relationships, reduce misunderstanding and conflicts, strengthen cooperation, and foster understanding. It is proactive, accountable and professional.</td>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><a name="activity_model">activity model</a></td>
			<td>Represented by activity diagrams are graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and concurrency. In the Unified Modeling Language, activity diagrams  describe the business and operational step-by-step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><a name="aggregation">aggregation</a></td>
			<td>A variant of the "has a" or <a href="#association">association</a> relationship; aggregation is more specific than association. It is an association that represents a part-whole or part-of relationship. As a type of association, an aggregation can be named and have the same adornments that an association can. However, an aggregation may not involve more than two classes. Aggregation can occur when a class is a collection or container of other classes, but where the contained classes do not have a strong life cycle dependency on the container - essentially, if the container is destroyed, its contents are not.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><a name="association">association</a></td>
			<td>In the <a href="#uml">UML</a>, represents a family of links. Binary associations (with two ends) are normally represented as a line.

There are four types of association: bi-directional, uni-directional, <a href="#aggregation">aggregation</a> (includes composition aggregation) and <a href="#reflexive">reflexive</a>. Bi-directional and uni-directional associations are the most common ones.</td>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><a name="class">class</a></td>
			<td>A construct that is used to create instances of itself - referred to as class instances, class objects, instance objects or simply objects. A class defines constituent members which enable its instances to have state and behavior. Data field members (member variables or instance variables) enable a class instance to maintain state. Other kinds of members, especially methods, enable the behavior of class instances. Classes define the type of their instances. A class usually represents a noun, such as a person, place or thing, or something nominalized. For example, a "Banana" class would represent the properties and functionality of bananas in general. A single, particular banana would be an instance of the "Banana" class, an object of the type "Banana".

<p>The ETO manages, monitors, and controls the development and maintenance of the EA. The ETO staff includes direct-report Enterprise Architects and various non direct-report general fund architects, enterprise department architects and solution/system architects (Figure 6). When business priorities established by the DDAC and/or Department Governance require specialized skills, the Chief Enterprise Architect may utilize architect resources to achieve the overall interest of the city wherever EA Personnel reside. The CEA coordinates these special conditions with the Department IT Leader or relevant supervisor. This provides significant benefit - first, the architect gains valuable mentoring opportunity to increase their skills and second, directs EA resources toward the overall city priority projects. The added exposure also provides Enterprise Architects body of knowledge of the EA repository. The ETO identifies and performs cost analysis of alternative approaches for developing the EA, and manages in-house or outside contractor EA development work if needed. Finally, the ETO determines needed resources and secures funding and resource commitments.</td>

			<td>A class relationship (is a) indicates that one of the two related classes (the subclass) is considered to be a specialized form of the other (the super type) and superclass is considered as generalization of subclass. In practice, this means that any instance of the subtype is also an instance of the superclass. An exemplary tree of generalizations of this form is found in binomial nomenclature: human beings are a subclass of simian, which are a subclass of mammal, and so on. The relationship is most easily understood by the phrase "an A is a B" (a human is a mammal, a mammal is an animal). The UML graphical representation of a generalization is a hollow triangle shape on the superclass end of the line (or tree of lines) that connects it to one or more subtypes. The generalization relationship is also known as the inheritance or (is a) relationship.</td>
