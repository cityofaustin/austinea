<h1 id="1_0">1.0 Introduction</h1>

<p>An Enterprise Architecture (EA) establishes the enterprise transformational plan to increase efficiencies and optimize mission performance.  It ensures optimal performance of core business processes within an efficient information technology (IT) environment. Enterprise architecture &quot;blueprints&quot; systematically define an organization's current (baseline) or desired (target) environment. Enterprise architectures are essential for evolving information systems and developing new systems that optimize their mission value. This is accomplished in logical or business terms (e.g., mission, business functions, information flows, and system environments) and technical terms (e.g., software, hardware, communications). Enterprise Architectures include Sequencing Plans for transitioning from the baseline environment to the target environment.

<p>These institutional architectural blueprints assist in optimizing the interdependencies and interrelationships among an organization's business operations and the underlying IT that support the mission. Without a complete and enforced EA, agencies may buy and build systems that are duplicative, incompatible, and unnecessarily costly.

<p>For the EA to be useful and provide business value, its development, maintenance, and implementation requires effective leadership and management. The systematic roadmap outlined in this document provides a disciplined and rigorous approach to EA life cycle management. It describes major EA management areas such as organizational structure and management controls; a process for development of a baseline and target architecture; and maintenance and implementation.

<p>Enterprise Architecture offers a promising opportunity for the City of Austin (COA). Enterprise Architecture is an innovation because it involves a new approach rather than an improvement on existing efforts. EA is the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change. The process involves creating, communicating, and improving key requirements, principles, and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution and transformation. The transformation process entails the analysis of an enterprise in its current state, and design of its ideal strategic, organizational and technological future state. EA is a complex endeavor, requiring senior leadership support to achieve the desired outcomes. 

<h2 id="1_1">1.1 Purpose</h2>

<p>This guide provides a process to initiate, implement, and sustain an EA program. It describes the roles and responsibilities for a successful EA practice. This guide establishes a citywide plan to increase efficiencies of department missions. It assists departments in optimizing their core business processes within an efficient IT environment.

<h2 id="1_2">1.2 Scope</h2>

<p>This guide describes the processes, activities, roles and responsibilities to initiate a successful EA practice at the City of Austin.

<h2 id="1_3">1.3 Audience</h2>

<p>This guide is primarily for COA leaders without existing EAs, and those that can benefit from improvements in their EA development and maintenance methods. The guidance in this document helps each department without an effective EA to establish one.

<h2 id="1_4">1.4 The Need for this Guide</h2>

<p>This guide is crucially important because, currently, there is no guidance to help manage the process of creating, changing, and using enterprise architecture. Effective development of a complete EA needs corporate commitment with senior business leader sponsorship. The EA facilitates change based on the organization's changing business environment. Effective implementation requires establishment of IT system compliance with the architecture and continuous assessment of compliance. Waiver of these requirements may occur only after careful, thorough, and documented analysis. 

<h1 id="2_0">2.0 Definitions, Drivers, and Principles</h1>

<h2 id="2_1">2.1 Enterprise Architecture Defined</h2>

<p>According to numerous architecture frameworks (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Architecture_Framework">DoDAF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_enterprise_architecture">FEAF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework">TOGAF</a>, etc.), Enterprise Architecture equals the integration of Business/Operational Architecture, Solution/System Architecture, and Technical/Standards Architecture. A well-accepted definition of EA is as follows:

<ul>
<li>Enterprise Architecture (EA) facilitates the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and improving the key requirements, principles, and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution and transformation. This transformation process entails the analysis and design of an enterprise in its current and future states from a strategic, organizational, and technological perspective.
</ul>

<p>If there's an architecture involved relevant to the enterprise, then EA is responsible for the architecture effort (the blueprint - the plan). This requires planning, training, mentoring, staffing, and changing processes to realize. Hence, the need for this guide. <a href="/austinea/definition/">Appendix A</a> contains a listing of additional EA terms, their definitions, and the source.

<h2 id="2_2">2.2 The Uses and Benefits of Enterprise Architecture</h2>

<p>John Zachman, the father of EA, said, &quot;Architecture is an asset, infrastructure, an investment, not an expense.&quot; The Return on Enterprise Architecture (RoEA) should calculate relative to the non-EA architecture baseline, the &quot;do nothing&quot; case. Unfortunately, there are no non-EA architecture performance measures to establish improved performance indicators. RoEA, therefore, is best determined through its intrinsic value to key performance &quot;business&quot; indicators. At today's pace of change, to conquer the soaring complexity, to deliver faster, better and be sustainable, the enterprise must achieve the following state: 

<ul>
<li><b>Streamlined:</b> integrated, simplified, to minimize unjustified variety, reduce unnecessary complexity, remove silos and improve focus
<li><b>Aligned:</b> information technology and people (organization) resources aligned to business processes and strategy to achieve the business objectives
<li><b>Agile:</b> modular, layered, standardized, technology independent, built out of services, quickly adapt to change through service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Cloud Computing
<li><b>Robust:</b> strategically planned according to business vision and technology trends
<li><b>Documented for ease of change:</b> a blueprint to document the current and target architecture to enhance comprehension and management of performance
</ul>

<p>Every enterprise has a structure, which could be in the form of an architecture. The enterprise's architecture informs, guides, and aligns  decisions, especially those related to IT investments. The challenge lies in maintaining the architecture as a primary authoritative resource without the use of enforced policy. With leadership support, EA's intrinsic value and utility encourages voluntary enterprise-wide adoption. 

<h2 id="2_3">2.3 Architecture Principles</h2>

<p>Principles establish the basis for a set of rules and behaviors for an organization. They govern either EA process or architecture implementation.  Architectural principles for the EA process affect development, maintenance, and use of the EA. Architectural principles for EA implementation establish the first tenets and related decision-making guidance for designing and developing information systems. The Chief Enterprise Architect works with the Chief Information Officer Council (CIOC) and select department business managers to  define the architectural principles to map the organization's IT vision and strategic plans. As shown in Figure 1, architectural principles represent fundamental requirements and practices to meet department's business needs. Specific actions such as EA development, systems acquisitions, and implementation map to the architectural principles. EA principles guide deliberate and explicit standards-oriented policies and guidelines for the EA development and implementation. The architecture principles support each phase of the system life cycle and govern CIOC actions.

<p><a href="/austinea/whitepaper/Roadmap/archPrinciples.htm" target="new_window">Appendix B</a> provides sample EA principles, their rationale, and their impact. Each department customizes these principles to meet their business needs. Formulating these supporting statements is essential part of the City's effort to define its principles.

<h2 id="2_4">2.4 The Enterprise Architecture Process</h2>

<p>As a prerequisite to the development of enterprise architecture, each department defines its vision, mission, capabilities, and measurable goals. The Enterprise Transformation Office assists departments in defining these elements in the Corporate EA. Figure 3 shows the EA process. After obtaining executive buy-in and support, each department creates an architectural team to define an approach and process. The architecture team  builds baseline and target EAs, develops a detailed gap analysis, and uses the gap analysis to generate a Sequencing Plan for the transition of systems, applications, and associated business practices. Once mature, departments use enterprise engineering, program management, prioritized incremental projects and emerging new technologies to strategically employ the architecture. Lastly, departments maintain their architecture through a continuous modification to reflect the department's current baseline and target business practices, organizational goals, visions, technology, and infrastructure.

<h1 id="3_0">3.0 Initiate Enterprise Architecture Program</h1>

<p>EA is a formal citywide program and a corporate asset. EA is a business stakeholder asset to deliver business requirements to IT solution providers such as Communications and Technology Management (CTM) or other city IT departments. Successful execution of the EA process requires citywide management, allocation of resources, continuity, and coordination. 

<p>Gaining executive commitment for any major initiative requires the development of a strong business case and a communications approach to convey the purpose. Since the concept of an EA is not intuitively obvious, the CIOC and the Chief Enterprise Architect creates a marketing strategy to communicate the strategic and tactical value for EA development to senior City executives, and business units.

<h2 id="3_1">3.1 Issue an Executive Enterprise Architecture Strategy</h2>

<p>The CIOC, in collaboration with the Department Directors Advisory Council (DDAC) and IT Steering Committee (ITSC), develops a strategy based on the City's architecture principles. The ITSC-approved EA strategy at a minimum includes the following:

<ul>
<li>Purpose and value of an EA 
<li>Relationship of the EA to the City's strategic vision and plans 
<li>Relationship of the EA to governance coordination and exception process 
<li>How business strategies translate into EA strategies, goals, and objectives
<li>How the EA will be developed, implemented, and maintained
<li>Chief Enterprise Architect responsibilities 
<li>Enterprise Transformation Office (ETO) establishment 
</ul>

<h2 id="3_2">3.2 Obtain Support from Senior Executives and Business Units</h2>

<p>Maintaining the participation and support of key executives is crucial to sustaining a successful effort. The CIOC initiates a marketing program to emphasize the value of architecture and obtain organizational governance commitment from all departments. The senior executive team and its organizational units are both stakeholders and users of the architecture. The target audience varies among departments, and  may include assistants, deputies and their key staff. The CIOC, working with the Chief Enterprise Architect as needed, familiarizes staff with what an EA is and how it can help achieve organizational goals and commitments. Participation involves the executives or their designees attending planning sessions, committing resources (people and funding) for specific tasks, and becoming champions for their effort.

<p>This briefing includes the following:

<ul>
<li>An executive summary explaining EA's value
<li>The City Manager's vision for the enterprise and the role of EA in accomplishing that vision
<li>The tenets of EA 
<li>EA benefits as an agent of change in achieving organizational goals 
<li>How EA helps IT teams evaluate options for change as business and technology needs evolve
<li>The roles and responsibilities of the senior executives and their organizational units in developing, implementing, and maintaining the EA
<li>An explanation of why stakeholders should provide skilled resources, support, and time to the effort
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3_3">3.3 Establish Management Relationships</h2>

<p>Enterprise Architecture delivers business and operational architectural requirements to IT service providers as a guide to implement successful business solutions. EA aligns technology to the business needs of the enterprise. It develops and oversees the solution/system architecture in close coordination with business applications and infrastructure management functions. EA provides a tool containing the enterprise body of knowledge (BoK). EA is a business enabler, and requires business leaders to direct, oversee and approve EA strategic direction for COA departments. Figure 4 is an entity relationship diagram identifying the key roles between various organizational resources and EA personnel. This diagram is the basis for the following organizational roles and responsibilities discussion.

The CIO leads the city IT workforce and recruits the best employees to complete the information and communications technology (ICT) mission. The CIO works with departmental IT leaders to map out the ICT strategy and policy of the city. The ICT strategy covers planning, procurement and external and internal standards laid out by the city. Similarly, the CIO establishes the ICT policy, detailing utilization and application of ICT. The CIO provisions finance, recruitment of professionals and development of policy and strategy. The CIO guides the overall direction of the Enterprise Architecture in concurrence with DDAC, ITSC and Department Governance priorities.</td>

<td id="cioc">Chief Information Officer Council</td>
<td>Chaired by the city's CIO, the CIO Council (CIOC) consists of general fund and enterprise Department IT Leaders and act in the capacity of a technical review committee, manages the review of candidate technology projects, and assesses recommended strategic technology direction. The CEA provides architecture recommendations to the CIOC and the CIOC determines final technical direction. For example, CEA may recommend one commonly shared ESB as a citywide service to achieve an enterprise-wide SOA framework, the CIOC may decide on an alternative direction. The CIOC provides the CEA opportunity to bring architecture concerns to the agenda for guidance and determination. CIOC members may delegate responsibility to a designated department Enterprise Architect with the understanding the department architect keep the CIOC member informed on important architecture decisions. When all department Enterprise Architects concur on a technology solution, this does not necessitate elevation to the CIOC for decision. However, the CEA is responsible to provide the CIOC status on important EA decisions. The CIOC assesses each proposed technology investment for compliance with the EA when relevant. The CIOC reports their conclusions to Department Governance and/or DDAC and ITSC. Finally, the CIOC ensures the Innovation Office coordinates new technologies through the ETO to ensure compliance or possible change of the EA strategy.</td>

<p>The ETO manages, monitors, and controls the development and maintenance of the EA. The ETO staff includes direct-report Enterprise Architects and various non direct-report general fund architects, enterprise department architects and solution/system architects (Figure 6). When business priorities established by the DDAC and/or Department Governance require specialized skills, the Chief Enterprise Architect may utilize architect resources to achieve the overall interest of the city wherever EA Personnel reside. The CEA coordinates these special conditions with the Department IT Leader or relevant supervisor. This provides significant benefit - first, the architect gains valuable mentoring opportunity to increase their skills and second, directs EA resources toward the overall city priority projects. The added exposure also provides Enterprise Architects body of knowledge of the EA repository. The ETO identifies and performs cost analysis of alternative approaches for developing the EA, and manages in-house or outside contractor EA development work if needed.

Many infrastructure elements are specific to the department mission and require department oversight - usually not involving EA. However, there are many shared infrastructure service elements. The purpose of the  shared infrastructure service principle is to identify shared infrastructure services and agree, through the CIOC, which department is best equipped to maintain and provide the service. These departments are sometimes referred to as centers-of-excellence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="itpm">IT Project Management</td>
<td>As an organizational resource, departments sometimes differ in their employment of IT Project Management. Some departments have project management offices such as Austin Energy and CTM provides a project management office for general fund projects. No matter the organizational resource structure, IT Project Management is responsible to plan implementation of the Business Stakeholder delivered business architecture. These planning functions frequently include coordination with Business Applications and Infrastructure Management organizational resource functions. 

<p>ETO is a liaison and consultant to the Business Stakeholder and IT Project Management. Working directly for the Business Stakeholder, ETO creates an architecture to capture the business needs such as purpose, vision, mission, capabilities, business goals, scope, process, functional needs, success factors and other business technical requirements to complete the business architecture. On approval, the Business Stakeholder delivers the business architecture to IT Project Management. IT Project Management uses the business architecture to plan implementation (RFP development, contracting, coordinate resource needs, planning, outsourcing strategies, etc.). If IT Project Management identifies required changes to the business architecture deliverable, possibly due to technology considerations, strategies, etc., IT Project Management coordinates with the ETO (per guidance by the Business Stakeholder) to make necessary Business Stakeholder approved corrections or updates. During architecture collaboration sessions, IT Project Management may participate to obtain better business understanding regarding architecture design considerations and other business conclusions drawn. 

<p>IT Project Management challenges include risk management, evaluation strategy and total cost of ownership among others. The IT Project Management may consult with ETO to gain insightful knowledge regarding important risk elements leading to a successful project plan. Because architecture focuses on important interfaces (e.g., business prescribed functional requirements and interfaces), this greatly simplifies risk identification and is useful in scope understanding and therefore total cost of ownership. In many circumstances, the architecture reduces or eliminates risk - depending on the complexity of the project. The architecture's clear scope also provides avenues to explore evaluation strategies leading to risk reduction, Cloud computing, and Small Minority Business Resource (SMBR) opportunities among others. The Business Stakeholder may request ETO to participate in these discussions or possibly liaison on the Business Stakeholder's behalf. For large scale, enterprise-wide architectures, the Office of the City Manager or the CIOC may request the ETO to manage the business and solution architecture on behalf of multiple Business Stakeholder and IT Project Management functions.</td>

Based on DDAC-prescribed EA direction, oversight and approval, the ITSC determines whether proposed projects fit within the overall budgeting and funding goals for the general fund portion of the city. While a project may be technically in compliance with the EA, the ITSC may reject funding for a project because of other external constraints or budgetary reasons. ITSC decisions may necessitate updates to EA plans.</td>

<h2 id="3_4">3.4 EA Training</h2>

<p>Enterprise architecture is not a trivial skill to learn. Candidates require significant business process and technology experience. Certified by the CEA, the Enterprise Architect delivers business/operation, solution/system and technical/standards architectures. Training takes approximately one year (3 to 7 hours/week) plus an additional year of on-the-job-training with an experienced Enterprise Architect. The CEA certifies the candidate Enterprise Architect once observable performance demonstrates ability to capture architecture artifacts in the EA repository. Certification provides unsupervised read/write access to the city's EA repository.

<p>The Chief Enterprise Architect is responsible for developing an EA training program to train future architects on the principles and processes used to develop the citywide enterprise architecture. See <a href="https://cityofaustin.github.io/austinea/training/TrainingPlan/">EA Training Plan</a> for more information.
 
<h1 id="4_0">4.0 Summary</h1>

<p>This guide to EA development, maintenance, and use assists the City in initiating, developing, and maintaining an EA program. The EA is a model of the City's enterprise and its future direction. Its value to the business operations should be more than simply IT investment decision management. The dynamic changes in technology and business practices impose greater pressure on the City to respond more rapidly than ever before. The EA reduces the response times for impact assessment, tradeoff analysis, strategic plan redirection, and tactical reaction.
