<p>The following architecture principles derive from the many architectural principles identified throughout the available architecture literature. They are presented as a starting point in the architecture process. Each individual Agency, with unique needs and requirements, should first consider these, then modify, add to, or replace this list as appropriate to its purposes.

<p>1. Architectures must be appropriately scoped, planned, and defined based on the intended use
of the architecture.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Rationale:</b> The architecture development effort needs direction and guidance to meet expectations for specific uses of the architecture end products. Detailed models may not be needed for high-level decision making; similarly, simple, descriptive architectures may not provide enough information to support engineering choices.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Implications:</b> The architecture must be generated with a specific purpose and for a specific
audience to ensure it meets the expectations of its intended stakeholders.

<p>2. Architectures must be compliant with the law as expressed in legislative mandates, executive orders, Federal regulations, and other Federal guidelines.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Rationale:</b> City Agencies must abide by laws, policies, and regulations. However, this does not preclude business process improvements that lead to changes in policies and regulations.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Implications:</b> City Agencies should be aware of laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the development of architectures and the collection, retention, management, and security of data. Changes in the law and changes in policy may drive changes in architectural processes or applications.

<p>3. Architectures facilitate change.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Rationale:</b> In the rapidly changing IT environment, organizations need tools to manage and control their business and technical growth and change. As the technical development life cycle shortens, with new technologies replacing older systems every 18 months, organizations require an overarching architecture to capture their systems design and operating environment.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Implications:</b> The systems developer and the chief architect should ensure the coordination between technology investments and business practices. Architectures must be used in the evaluation function of the Capital Planning and Investment Control process.

<p>4. Enterprise architectures must reflect the Agency's strategic plan.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Rationale:</b> The target architecture has maximum value when it is most closely aligned with the organization.s strategic plan and other corporate-level direction, concepts, and planning.

<p style="margin-left: .25in;"><b>Implications:</b> The target architecture must be developed in concert with strategic planners as well as the operational staff. As the strategic plan changes, so do the future environment and the target architecture.
