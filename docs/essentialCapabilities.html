<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; font-size: 11pt;">Enterprise Architecture Perspective on Essential Capabilities</p>

<p>Both business and information technology (IT) domains recognize the value of identifying <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#capability">capability</a> as a decision-making framework leading to efficient delivery of important business outcomes. Although possibly considered a semantic discussion by some, labeling our capabilities with emphasis on the desired outcome is important - in particular, it's important to align with our enterprise architecture (EA) process. As a matter of EA principle, we use a verb/noun vernacular to label terms and definitions - business architects and quality management professionals consider this industry best practice. In terms of definition, capabilities result in an important outcome with action (verb) producing the outcome. For example, Asset Management has more of an organizational implication than an outcome focus. Alternately, Manage Assets is the preferred method to label a capability or business service. Capabilities represent a <a href="/austinea/definition/index.html#capability">service</a> provided to a stakeholder with interest in the outcome - i.e., well managed assets. As another example is Public Safety Management. From an outcome (service) viewpoint, this should be Manage Public Safety where the public's safety is the outcome. One might also call this Provide for a Safe Public where a safe public is the outcome. We must consider other important factors.</p>

<p>Currently, we identify all our capabilities as &quot;essential&quot; when in fact, some are &quot;common&quot; and others are &quot;support&quot; capabilities. When it's a common capability, it delivers directly to the outcomes of the business domain. When it's a support capability, it's a service used by the business domain, but does not directly service the business domain outcome. Manage Human Capital, for example, is a support capability - business domains use Manage Human Capital services; however, these services do not directly relate to the goods and services provided by the business domain. Whereas, Manage Assets is a common capability among business domains; and therefore, it's directly relevant to delivering goods and services (i.e., business outcomes). This is an important distinction when making business-decisions.</p>

<!-- Table definition -->
<table align="center" id="custom">
<tr><th>Capability</th><th>Definition</th><th>Existing Systems</th><th>Common/Support</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Assets</td>
<td>Provide City of Austin leadership with information about the disposition and use of assets to support efficient and effective use.</td>
<td>Maximo, Hansen, Symphony, and supporting technology currently provide this capability.</td>
<td>Common. Assets are probably the most critical element managed by our city. Roads, bridges, right-of-ways, buildings, land, vehicles, utility infrastructure etc. are common throughout the city - even essential to Manage Public Safety. Doing this efficiently provides huge cost savings by developing optimal asset investment strategies to ensure reliable and dependable assets while preventing costly damage due to neglect resulting from poor asset lifecycle management (ex., roof leaks causing costly repair because reroofing did not occur within lifecycle timeline, water main breaks because of inadequate replacement schedule, etc.).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Case Files</td>
<td>Provides efficient and reliable workflow management typically for non-asset managed items such as permits, legal processes, regulatory compliance, etc. - ensures proper coordination with various city departments along with official record of regulatory compliance. Provides case managed records for development compliance, public health, and legal services to ensure efficient and proper processes for citizen provided services.</td>
<td>AMANDA, EPCR and Versadex are examples currently providing this capability.</td>
<td>Common. This capability is hard to address from an enterprise application viewpoint. For example, Manage Case Files is also important to Manage Assets because workflow management is also essential to procure, lease or sell assets. Manage Case Files is likely to always have multiple application solutions depending on the business domain. However, enterprise applications can assist in many workflow management needs such as Ensure Regulatory Compliance and Manage Court Case Files where assets are not typically relevant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Official Documents</td>
<td>Electronically collect and managed official documents derived from multiple sources, recover documents to meet legal and regulatory requirements, provide publically accessible historical information and manage document retention policies.</td>
<td>Enterprise Document Imaging and Management System (EDIMS).</td>
<td>Common. Based on business domain needs, capability requires integration with Manage Case Files applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Business Intelligence</td>
<td>Ability to identify, analyze, transform and present disparate information sources using data marts, data warehouses, presentation tools and methods to provide leadership with actionable, decision-making information.</td>
<td>Cognos, QlikView, and MicroStrategy are common BI applications used by the City of Austin.</td>
<td>Common. Many common and support capabilities depend on this capability - considered by business domains as a high value capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobilize the Work Force</td>
<td>Ability to manage and perform information technology functions using mobile devices. Provides business domain users access to internal city IT resources while working in the field.</td>
<td>Smart phones (HTC, iPhone, Android), tablet devices (iPad) are examples.</td>
<td>Common. This is the most common capability need. Business domains need to extend their office applications into the field yielding much improved efficiencies while saving a tremendous amount of labor time and delayed information updates. The paper savings is likely larger than Manage Human Capital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide Geographic Information</td>
<td>Provides the City staff the ability to manage, analyze and report location data (i.e., geospatial information) for use by  staff to conduct business and citizens to stay informed with city geospatial information.</td>
<td>ESRI ArcGIS, Small World</td>
<td>Common. Many business units rely heavily on geospatial information. In addition, there's a large dependence by Provide a Mobile Workforce for asset location, incident identification and navigational purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Financials</td>
<td>Provides enterprise tools to gather, analyze, manage and communicate financial decisions to staff and citizens.</td>
<td>AIMS, eCAPRIS, eCOMBS and other supporting utilities to manage and deliver financial information for City leadership and its citizens.</td>
<td>Support. Business domains did not identify this capability as a common or support capability need. This is a similar category as Manage Human Capital. It's needed, but not considered problematic by business domains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Human Capital</td>
<td>Supports the City's ability to attract, select, train, assess, and reward employees, while also overseeing organizational leadership and culture, and ensuring compliance with employment and labor laws to support City leadership, employees, and retirees.</td>
<td>BANNER, eJobs, ePIF, ePAF and other utilities provide employee records, development, pay & benefits and reporting to City leadership, employees, and retirees.</td>
<td>Support. Business entities have not identified this capability as problematic. This implies the current Manage Human Capital capability is meeting the needs of our enterprise. A few business domains identified Provide Succession Planning as the only Manage Human Capital sub-capability needing improvement (possibly overlooked by some). This doesn't imply that it's not important to Human Resources Department. However, business domains don't consider this capability a pressing issue compared to other business outcome needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage IT Infrastructure</td>
<td>The City's information technology staff and services establish, operate and maintain the COA's IT hardware, software, networks, service desk and security systems to provide data and information to City staff and its citizens.</td>
<td>COATN, routers, servers, desk top PCs, Exchange servers are examples.</td>
<td>Support. Business domains did not identify any goals related to IT infrastructure issues. This fits in the same category as Manage Human Capital and Manage Financials, which are department specific needs with no direct, common implications on service delivery - i.e., it's essential, but not problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Public Safety</td>
<td>Delivers business and technology management services to support the delivery of code compliance, court, emergency medical services, fire, homeland security, emergency management and police services to the citizen and regional business partners.</td>
<td>Combined Transportation and Emergency Communications Center, wireless, Computer Aided Dispatch</td>
<td>Support. This is a domain specific capability. The capability is too broad in scope - if included, we should also include Provide Clean Water, Provide Reliable Energy, etc. as they're all essential capabilities. Recommend an EA analysis of the Manage Public Safety capability to determine shared and common services between public safety departments to derive service level capabilities similar in scope to those previously identified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Engage Citizens</td>
<td>Engage citizens to conduct political, social and financial business using Web technologies such as information portals, social networks and on-line payment services to distribute information and perform commerce with employees, citizens and other interested stakeholders.</td>
<td>Examples include AustinGo, Facebook, and the ability to perform electronic commerce.</td>
<td>Currently, business domains have not identified a need for this capability as either support or common - current capability is likely meeting current business needs. This is more an IT infrastructure need than a business domain requirement. Recommend merging this with Manage IT Infrastructure. This doesn't imply that it's not important; rather, it's not consistent with other capability abstractions currently identified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Communications</td>
<td>Provide radio, telephone, video conference and wireless technology to deliver voice, video and data information for staff and citizens to conduct city business.</td>
<td>Voice over internet protocol (VOIP) the new phone system and dispatch radio systems are examples.</td>
<td>This is not a capability; rather, Manage Communications is an enabler of other capabilities. Manage Communications belongs to Manage IT Infrastructure. Recommend removal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage Engineering</td>
<td>The ability to provision Public Works, Austin Water Utility, Austin Energy and other business units with the tools and services needed to manage civil engineering to deliver safe and cost effective infrastructure to the City's citizens.</td>
<td>SCADA, electrical power management, construction engineering tools are examples of this capability.</td>
<td>This is not a capability; rather, a process to manage other city capabilities such as Provide Clean Water, Provide Reliable Energy, etc. Recommend removal.</td>
