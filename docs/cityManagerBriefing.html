<p>Anthony/Stephen,</p>

<p>Successfully employing Enterprise Architecture (EA) into our city culture is not a trivial endeavor. For example, some people view EA as some sort of threat, edict, an unnecessary administrative hurtle, among other perceived notions - as if EA is going to tell business what to do. In reality, EA is a process - a process to guide business organizations to discover their own efficiencies and improvements. EA breaks down silos by identifying cross-department dependencies and shared goals. EA does not impose any solution; rather, EA provides a consistent and repeatable process to aid leadership through an enterprise decision-making process. As enterprise architects, we're merely facilitators of the process. Due to our extensive IT experience, we recommend business functions and translate them into understandable IT specifications driven by business needs. To create an EA culture could take many years. However, once in place, our EA culture empowers business to drive successful IT solutions to realize best managed city. We need to begin the discussion with city leadership to determine an optimal approach within our city culture to realize the EA vision. Otherwise, what's the point in having an EA practice?</p>

<p>Below is the executive summary for the Enterprise Architecture presentation to the CMO. I also attached a <a href="http://austinea.org/docs/cityManagerBriefing.docx">version for signature</a> (follow link) - per procedure. I'll require some guidance on the meeting date. We should set aside at least an hour (if not more) to introduce EA (30 minutes) and entertain a discussion on what it takes to realize a successful EA practice.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Action Items for CMO Meeting:</p>

<p>Assemble City Management Office leadership to learn about Enterprise Architecture and discuss a way forward.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY:</p>

<p>An Enterprise Architecture (EA) establishes a citywide roadmap to accomplish operational missions through optimal performance of its core business processes within an efficient information technology (IT) environment. Simply stated, enterprise architectures are "blueprints" to systematically define our organization's current (baseline) and desired (target) environment. Enterprise architectures are essential for evolving information systems and developing new systems to optimize their mission value. This is accomplished in business terms (mission, business functions, information flows, and system environments) and technical terms (software, hardware, and communications), and includes a Sequencing Plan for transitioning from the baseline environment to the target environment.</p>

<p>These institutional blueprints assist in optimizing the interdependencies and interrelationships among our city's business operations and the underlying IT that support the mission. Experience has shown that without a complete and enforced EA, agencies run the risk of buying and building systems that are duplicative, incompatible, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and integrate.</p>

<p>Enterprise Architecture offers a promising opportunity for the City of Austin; however, it requires leadership support to succeed.</p>
